<p>The Mother
Is always there
The Father
Needs to hear your call</p>
<p>Just as
The earth</p>
<p>Always supports your weight
And the heavens
Descend to your voice</p>
<p>I am blessed to touch solitude.
Finally, for a month, after 3 frenzied communal years.
I get to be here, at Amritapuri, this ashram
The home of Mahadevi Herself, here, for us all.</p>
<p>And I can introspect
Undisturbed, Unbidden
Holding tenderly each day
The quiet waves of being.</p>
<p>Make some tender friendships
(remain open to their happening, anyway)
And read, read, read.
The bliss of the Word
Not with a goal, just for fun.</p>
<p>Finally, for the Self
There’s only patience,
Waiting, praying,
Tender awakening comes.</p>
<p>I prostrate myself as an internal art.
It is a posture of mind,
To practice without seeking
External validation.</p>
<p>How can I be truly humble?
Not a false pretense
Adopted to appear Holy
But truly knowing
That all of You
Is That, and
As such, has keys
To the universal teaching.</p>
<p>I don’t know.
I can only behave as if it were
True in the hope
That someday I will find
Vanity &amp; Pride
Have gone, and I forgot
To miss them in their quiet absence.</p>

<p>I have gained and lost nothing.
Born, named, educated.
And yet, beyond it all
I Am That.</p>
<p>In its folly the mind
With its shackles of habit
Thinks such and such is possible
Or not.</p>
<p>A human birth is a tremendous occasion
For knowledge, for truth.
Consciousness drives everything.
Having given up everything for God
All things are then possible.</p>
<p>The mind spins, caught in a furious drumroll.
Please, release those thoughts
Which are any less than true
Honest seeking for It, in You.</p>
<p>There isn’t, there is
I am That. I Am perfect
Year after year, I am learning to learn
I am fascinated with that process within myself.</p>
<p>The advantage of being out in the world
(a freelancer)
Is that I can take risks
Take the time to explore
I don’t want to Do
Only to Be
With tremendous force
To allow Being
Which decimates all false motives
Leaving only dharma in its wake
For that is all I Am
Is Force
I Am That</p>

<p>“I feel the wounds in my heart. I feel very young in this moment.”</p>
<p>Laying supine on the table, he released the weight of his legs into my hands. Knees pointed up towards the sky, bent at the hinge, tibias parallel to the ground. I’m holding his ankle and his knee, guiding him through hip circles that I learned in Andrea Olsen’s Bodystories.</p>
<p>The exercise goes like this:
” Lift the right leg until the femur is perpendicular to the earth, the knee relaxed and the foot off the floor. Begin to trace tiny circles with the right knee on the ceiling, as though you were drawing with a pencil attached to your knee. Move very slowly, so you are working underneath the big muscle groups and stimulating the deep rotators and the joint capsule. You may experience nervous system “jerks” as the big muscles let go and the deeper muscles are stimulated - allow these jerks.</p>
<p>Move slowly. Gradually increase the size of the circle until it is the range of your hip joint. If you are very relaxed, you may be able to trace the rim of your hip socket with the neck of the femur. Don’t go beyond your comfort level at this slow speed.</p>
<p>Reverse the direction of the circles until you are again making tiny circles around the perpendicular axis of the leg.</p>
<p>Place the foot on the floor and do the other leg. Remember the slower you work, the deeper the release in this particular exercise. O Repeat at another time with a partner holding and circling your leg so you can release all muscles except the stabilizing side. Again, go slowly! Support the knee carefully from underneath and hold the heel.”</p>
<p>I’ve slowed down. Life seems like a long, long endeavour. Awash in uncertainty about the future, I ask myself: How can I devote my life to service?</p>
<p>Listening for the feedback inside the layers of self, I take stock of what arises.</p>
<p>Pathology develops when stillness becomes immobility. The crystallization of certainty is a death sentence.  If I take a stance and hold it too firmly, it will congeal into rigidity. Eventually to be ripped away from me by force. Any fixed sense of solidity is an illusion. All energy gathers only to disperse. Slowly, I am learning to detach from my preconception of who I am. I do not know where life will take me. I cannot hold on to anything forever. Breathe it in, feel it, then let it out, let it go.</p>
<p>So I breathe. I allow the movement of the breath to change me. Notice, it reaches its apex, stands still, then disperses. Empty, it rests in dynamic stillness, waiting. Before long, the pressure of the void pulls air into the empty space, fulfilling the cycle anew.</p>
<p>I feel my breath. I feel the wave up and down my spine as I stand here, I am in motion. I feel like if I stop moving my body will collapse. Breath responds to need. It flows in tandem with the whole body’s organization, with every cell’s rhythm.</p>
<p>Reaching around my desk I pick up a familiar book and read again a phrase: God is change. Octavia Butler’s protagonist in The Parable Of The Sower, a novel from 1990 set in 2025, uttered truth. It has the same ring of truth as Vedanta, as Torah, as the Daodejing.</p>
<p>I remind myself that she was right, and that God is itself a process of becoming, mutating, iterating. I find God in movement, ongoing. When I surrender to the process and allow the act to transform me fundamentally, then I can rise from the ashes.</p>
<p>God, though? I’ve grown to love that word. I choose it instead of “Universe”, or “Divinity”, or even “Love”, because it is the only word which gets at the truth of my experience. It states that there is a principle behind this small world. I use the word God because it is the one word in the english language which does not hide, does not couch itself or make itself small.</p>
<p>I don’t choose the word Divinity because it is too small. It is an adjective, a quality of this universe. God is divine. Nature is divine. The smell of fresh sourdough is divine. Divinity is not God. Neither is God the universe. God is not within this universe.</p>
<p>I can conceive of the universe, see, I can create a map of it, a schema, and explain it. I can look at the universe with my physical eyes. I cannot see God using my sense organs. God is the underlying principle. The flow, the pattern. Change.</p>
<p>Any words I use will fail to get at the truth of it. Just like every other mind before this one, every other act of scribing to get the truth of God on the page can only ever serve as a gesture. I can point to the moon but the words on the page will always remain the finger.</p>
<p>Staying on the path means giving up all semblance of “willpower” in the sense of ‘it is my will to do this’—rather, to undertake the journey is accompanied by a relinquishment. I can direct my intention towards some goal all day long, but what about complete, total surrender? What if what I’m doing is exactly what’s meant to happen? What if the overarching goal is God?</p>
<p>The pattern is bound between body and sky. I’ve found that the work of self-discovery is also a process of getting to know the larges revolving cycles in which I am growing.</p>
<p>The soil is so fertile in Kerala. Everywhere I look, life blooms with an irrepressable vigour. The tropics have been nourished by untold millenia of life growing, dying, decaying, It all returns to the ground, decomposing in the solar oven. But then, it hasn’t always been so hot. Weeks on end of heat such that it’s dangerous. Humidex over 40, maybe 30 at night. And now, unpredictable rains. What’s happening to the pattern?</p>
<p>Human accumulation, centuries of industrial expansion, reaching the western shoreline of south Bharat. The mon soon gathers, but its regularity is lost. A new pattern emerges. [She] (who?) can’t tell me when the rains will pour without looking at her phone, but she knows for certain that things have changed.
Childhood here, what was it like?
50 years ago, what was different?
Now, I’m told to watch out for the snails. A resident warns me, pointing at my shoes, not to get slime on my feet, because “it can cause meningitis. If you see children playing with the snaisl, make sure you warn them off. Don’t scare them, but make sure they’re careful.”</p>
<p>The pattern is heard in juxtapositions. I sit and chant the thousand names of the Divine Mother. All else fades away. Immediately upon completion, I’ away of heavy machinery construction happening right next door. I hear the engines and smell the fumes. My first though is: How can I find God in a world of fossil fuels and toxic air?</p>
<p>But then, She is the rhyme and reason of these things. Scale back and I witness how the animate life of epochs past are in relationship with my present. I bear witness to Devi’s presence within the noise. The pounding of mechanical hammers, the smell of burning. The deep time it took for carbon to compress into oil, to gather so much potential energy. And then, the release that powers the tools. This is God’s pattern.</p>
<p>It is human fuolly which has built and extraxted at scale to run a civilization of illogical, lawless greed. IT is not the pattern that is wrong. It will always find balance. It is the deviations of naive humans runnign after dreams of power fueled by lust, the illusion of infinite growth, expansion, extraction.</p>
<p>We have broken the covenant with nature. How do I, then, find my rightful place within the pattern?</p>
<p>The covenant is the rule of reciprocity amidst all aniate beings. It is the shared understanding that the whole-earth system is interpendent,. Each concentric ring of the entire world of beings, from the smallest scale up to the unfathomably vasty, are accountable to each other.</p>
<p>But scale is tricky. Are bacteria minuscule or immense? They are both. I owe a debt to the bacteria, and they owe a debt to me. We are allies, nemeses, but whether we life it or not, we share a world, share bodies, share food.</p>
<p>Karma is the pattern.</p>
<p>“The law of karma means the law of causation, of inevitable cause and sequence. By law is meant the tendency of a pattern to repeat itself. [vyati]. Law is the method, the manner in which our mind grasps a series of phenomena.” (Sw. V, V.1, II, 7. Karma Yoga, “Freedom”.)</p>
<p>We can become One when we acknowledge reciprocity.</p>
<p>Can I distinguish what belons to me from what does not?</p>
<p>Remission is not a fixed state, it is a practice, a process.</p>

<p>The twin oars which propel the boat are Faith and Self-Effort.
I found a prayer in a book, and allowed it to become my mantra:
Please help me
Please show me the way
Please open my heart to thy way
Please teach me infinite love
Years later, it became clear
Amma had heard my call
Had always heard the calls.</p>
<p>One morning, I found myself singing
It dawns upon me that I am helped
And I do not know by whom or what
And still, I pray to you
My girlfriend knew, but she had learned
Years ago, that we each make our own way home</p>
<p>I spent years worshipping idols—
Names of the goddess that came across my path
Each time, each utterance, brought Her
Presence into direct experience
I saw faces change into Hers
I met Her in dream
I ran into her on the street.</p>
<p>I was so intellectual.
I found I could apply my thinking to the study of Religion,
and every other problem of philosophy fell away.
I tested every spiritual technology I got my hands on.
I thought magic would point the way to healing.</p>
<p>I do not accept help easily.
It’s ingrained that I must do everything myself.
I was taught that I live inside a war zone.
A body fighting itself.
Decades later, I learned that only peace cures war.
No amount of bombing will bring peace.</p>
<p>I was very ill for many years.
At age 5, allopaths diagnosed me
with a rare auto-immune condition.
This chemical imbalance left me at high risk of bleeding.
That illness was the defining factor of my life for the following 20+ years.
At the same time, in 2001, I injured my right eye, playing
Alone with a toy. The eye filled with blood,
Eventually I lost all functional sight.
But, this injury put us in the context to discover the bleeding,
Which could have been fatal if left unchecked, or if I had
Instead injured some internal organs.
The accident which cost me an eye
May have been grace, preventing
A much worse outcome.</p>
<p>As a result of the injury+illness, I spent my life
Transiting in and out of hospitals for treatment.
I had multiple surgeries, and was given a laundry list
Of medications, so went childhood.</p>
<p>I was blessed with a loving and supportive mother.
Her courage and steadfastness,
Her unwavering love, got me through it all.</p>
<p>13 years passed. I was anxious, depressed.
At age 18, I started drinking.
I was culturally normal. That’s what Canadian teenagers do.
Drink alcohol, do drugs, smoke cigarettes.
I got on the bandwagon, but perhaps
My medical history kept my cautious,
Stopped me going in too deep, even at the worst of times.</p>
<p>During my university years, I exhausted myself.
Got to the point of burnout, multiple times. I did not know how to listen to my body’s needs.
So I ended up back in the hospital.</p>
<p>Then, in 2019, a series of fortunate meetings brought me to a dance studio.
I fell in love with a strange social dance form known as contact improvisation.
It changed everything.
Suddenly, the body was not to be despised. It became a source of joy.
Eventually, of connection to myself and others.
The process was underway.
Then, covid happened.</p>
<p>When the pandemic began, I was grounded.
My meditation practice was steady.
I was basically a stable, decently happy student.
I had been moderate in my consumption for 2 years.
But I felt that something was missing.</p>
<p>It took a week of isolation for me to realize two things:
I have faith in God
I am not afraid to die.
Pandemic sat me down and made me look at the big questions.
I have since then been reckoning with the consequences.
I have made the search for direct religious experience a top priority.</p>
<p>I understand now that my faith did not cure me.
It gave me a reason to live.
A reason to find my own way to health.
I asked for help, and it took many forms.
But never could anyone change my mind for me.</p>
<p>It took complete and total re-evaluation of who I am
of What I am,
of what it means to live a good life.
That is what healed me.</p>
<p>Not medicine.
Not embodiment.
Not nutrition.
Not anything but the willingness to accept
That being alive is worth the effort.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>To have received a guru mantra is the single biggest spiritual change in my life.
As I write these words, the breeze carries a soft scent of roses.
Ishta devata’s presence is felt.
She is Mother, Warrior, Lover.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>May 24 2024</p>
<p>I’m interested in an animist immunology.
A spiritual immunology.
The idea of immunity is as vast as any other, right?
The immune system in the human body is an observation of modern science.
What’s the history of that idea?
Quelle est l’histoire de cette idée?
Pourquoi est-elle si populaire?
Comment fut-elle révolutionnaire?
Quelle idée la suit?</p>
<p>To be immune is to be protected against.
safe from,
to have some kind of guarantee
against harm—as in political immunity.</p>
<p>What about the networked immune response?
&amp; the immune//nervous connection?</p>
<p>L’image bactériologique normale/commune est fausse.
Qui est d’accord?
Siv, Margulis, Indigenous immunologists?</p>

<p>I believe immunity is an illusion.
It is Maya.
We can never be entirely protected.
That is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>I can only ever respond.
Immunity is an action,
not a fixed state.</p>
<p>The words: immune cascade
Like a waterfall.</p>
<p>What is inflammation?
Can there be immune response without it?
Are immunospressants, anti-inflammatories, and anti-histamines related?</p>
<p>Who is the goddess of immunity?
Justice <span>⇒</span> Homeo/stasis <span>⇒</span> balance/preserved</p>
<p>Immunity in ayurveda?
In the neijing?
In the shang han lun?
In homeopathy?
In orthopathy?</p>
<p>Only Atman is truly immune.
Immunity—does it imply changelessness?</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>May 25</p>
<p>There is nothing I need which She does not provide
She provides for
Each and all
Of your needs.
Cease the doubts.
That body you prize so highly
Has shown you the truth
There is no task more simple
Than the one meant for <em>you</em>
No question of whether it’s the right choice
Because all decisions are false.
This is karma, resulting of actions
made across all time
.
Now, I see. The task is, still,
To help, to heal.</p>
<p>What’s happened to me in 3 months:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 day authentic movement cert.</li>
<li>5 day silent retreat</li>
<li>got a mantra</li>
<li>visited the western ghats, pareiyar national park</li>
<li>Gave approx 50 bodywork sessions</li>
<li>Was exposed to Sw. Vivekananda</li>
<li>Took approx 20 yoga classes</li>
<li>Ate abundant fresh papaya, mango, banana</li>
<li>Visited a spice garden</li>
<li>Ate fresh raw cacao</li>
<li>Ate many south indian meals</li>
<li>Got 17 rounds of acupuncture</li>
<li>Saw an elephant</li>
<li>Saw monkeys</li>
<li>Met an Avatar</li>
<li>Stayed at an ashram</li>
<li>Heard approx 100 satsangs (2 per day, many days)</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand my work.</p>
<ol>
<li>With individuals: therapy to help them come to a sense of home in the bodies.</li>
<li>Stewarding the conversation about health.
Those are the practical aspects.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I leave in two nights, a devotee highlighted a key in his satsang:
Everything/everyone is your teacher</p>
<p>Amma said to a journalist: the only difference between you and I is that I know there is no difference between you and I.</p>
<p>I want to help.
Now, I have some tools.
I understand what a gift my early years were.
I have been learning to work since age 5.
I notice constantly how my decades of illness (in all forms it took) prepared me to heal.</p>
<p>I chose bodywork out of love. I read Deane Juhan’s work and found truth: culture starves us of touch, which is food. Without it, our wellbeing is measurably diminished. Infants die without touch. We need touch to survive.</p>
<p>Touch saved my life.
It brought me back from depths of depair.
It is difficult to express in words the gratitude I feel, having the chance to work with touch as a medium. To me, there is no greater gift.
I can say with absolute certainty that I’ve found my vocation, my calling.
In this, I feel like I will grow, learn, and deepen for my whole life.
The art and science of nourishing life.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I apply the techniques and ideas I’ve been taught ove the last 5 years of interest in somatic therapy.
The other part of it is presence. I am here.
I am listening.
My whole self is a tuning fork.</p>

<p>Lakshya Bhodan is needed out in the world.</p>
<p>To say I’ve learned a lot in the my months here is the understatement of the century.
I’ll be unwrapping this gift my whole life.
Will I be back? Only when the time is right, by guru’s grace.</p>
<p>The link is reestablished.
I was falling, drowning under the world’s waves.
She caught me.</p>
<p>I did not know
To whom, to what I called
All those days and nights
Grasping, hoping, crying
Out in the dark for some light
Turns out, She was listening all
Along, the way was set
And my freefall softly settled
In Mother’s arms.</p>
<p>“The immune system did not evolve to detect pathogens, it evolved to detect everything.”  — I undertake a philosophical project independent of any institution. Why? As a limb of yoga. To understand the reality of life. I aim to disentangle the concept that have defined me.</p>
<p>I have, still, many desires. I accept them. That’s the difference now.
I have now the confirmation that I can both a life for God <em>and</em> live out in the world. The answer to the paradox lives in selflessness. The secret of Karma is to accept. Work unattached, and accept that all is God’s doing. Not mine.</p>
<p>I have been blessed with the skills to do work that is of service to people physically and also spiritually. My work is part of the effort to uplift humanity, to liberate us from suffering.</p>
<p>Let my life serve as an example of what it means to live a good life, in love and light.</p>
<p>The events of my biography seem very small to me now. I witness the memories of suffering, lost, confused, terrified. Self-compassion arises in the heart, a rushing wave of warmth opening space in the body as it crashes on the shore of memory. All that is past. I am not the sick one.
I am not the diagnosed one.
I am not the lost one.
I am not the drug addicted one.
I am not the binge drinking one.
I am not the angry selfish one.
I am not the child.
Any longer.
I am That. And thought at times I will forget, I pray to remember. I pray to be That tool, always offering my work at the feet of God.</p>
<p>I write in the midst of it all, because I believe what Swami Vivekananda wrote: “the yogas of work, of wisdom, and of devotion are all capable of serving as direct and independent means of Moksha (liberation). Fools alone say that work and philosophy and different, not the learned. The learned know that they lead to the same goal of human perfection.”</p>
<p>It is important that I be understood. I am unlearning jargon, learning to convey complex ideas in simple language. My first book was not such an attempt. I wrote and self-published it as part of an alchemical healing process. I see in hindsight that the Heresy was an exorcism.</p></article><hr/><div class="page-footer"></div></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div class="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[],&quot;focusOnHover&quot;:false,&quot;enableRadial&quot;:false}"></div><button class="global-graph-icon" aria-label="Global Graph"><svg version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xml:space="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
