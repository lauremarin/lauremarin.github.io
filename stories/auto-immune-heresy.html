<p>Beginning the telling fills me with trepidation. My heart knows that
reliving these events won’t be easy for me, and would almost rather keep
silent, not bother sharing. With the encouragement and support of many
friends, I take a step forward, and begin.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It was 2001, high summer near the Salish Sea of Turtle Island’s Pacific
northwest. So-called Vancouver, British Columbia. I was 5 years old.
Life was a series of forest adventures, pre-school friendships, and
creative curiosities held warmly by my single mother’s devotion to
raising a child alone in her 40s. Being from colonized Gespe’gewa’gi on
the opposite ocean’s shore, she had made home in Vancouver during an
early adulthood spent traveling the world, fuelled by pure curiosity.
She was ready to have a child. Though her lover decided he couldn’t be a
father, she chose to become a mother.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Surrounded by friends, she brought me into a world full of infinite
possibility. She recounted myths and fed my love of story. We laughed to
the point of tears as she read me kid-friendly renditions of the
judeo-christian tradition; we imagined a world of justice and love, as
she nourished us both with tales of equality and ecology—new myths for
a changing planet.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I remember the story of a young princess, dark of skin, who ventures
into the enchanted forest. She gets lost, lost in her fear of the woods,
fear she received from her father. So the guardians of the ancient
groves, a dragon and a unicorn, show her how the forest is a place of
beauty. When the princess returns home, she shows her father, and he
recognizes his daughter’s wisdom. He changes his ways. He stops
destroying the forest.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I grew up feeling like the forest held all the world’s magic, all its
wisdom. I knew this to be the truth. My home was an environment in which
this ecstatic curiosity and passion for the world, its arts, its
stories, could flourish.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>There are many things my mother did not know, but she transmitted the
pieces that mattered. She underscored that in all the stories, and in
all our relations, the uniting, healing force, the bridge across enmity
and the conflictual sense of separateness, is love. As she shared the
stories of Adam, Abraham, Moses, she did not have the biting historical
comparative-mythology political-philosophy gender-studies critique I
would develop two decades later, when I went back to the scripture. Her
love of God was as simple and as pure as her love of a child she named
Matthieu-Xavier Marin. After the apostle, whose name she made a point of
telling me means “gift from god”—and her own father, François-Xavier, a
Gaspésien through-and-through, a heavy machinery mechanic whose career
was spent in Murdochville’s copper mine.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It was 2001, and I was 5 years old. Summer was coming to a head, the
temperate rainforest soaked up the sun’s rays. My days were filled with
play, with harmless games. One of those days, my friend and I were
brought to a seaside market gift-shop. My memories of Vancouver’s
markets are fond. I remember the smell of salt on the air, the smoked
salmon, the honey candies. I remember the seagulls arguing over the
leftover fries from the fish n’ chips stalls. I can still taste the
mango sorbet.</p>
</div>

<p>This story begins by accident.</p>

<p>A single page photocopy of an informational handout.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It is titled “General Guidelines for the Management of a Child with ITP”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In all likelihood, it was among the first documents that Maman received
from healthcare professionals after my diagnosis in 2001, and it appears
to be directed at schoolteachers. It’s a little bit outdated. Most
notably, ITP is now called ‘Immune Thrombocytopenia’ rather than
‘Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura’, and there are more treatment
options than two decades ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Writing in 2019, I have had an ITP diagnosis for 18 years.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Research from 2018 estimates that immune thrombocytopenia is found in
8.8 out of 100’000 children.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The same research also finds that in 25% of ITP cases, the condition
becomes chronic, persistent: it does not simply go away. New diagnosis:
Chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia, found in 2.2 out of 100’000 children.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I’m struck by a particular choice of words in the pamphlet:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“benign disease.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Medical conditions are called benign to suggest they are not dangerous
or serious. Benign can also mean kind, or kindly. I am one of the few
whose so-called benign disease turned into the chronic form.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>As if auto-immunity were ever benign.</p>
</div>
<div class="align-center">

<div class="align-right">
<p>In the first months of treatment</p>
</div>
<div class="align-right">
<p>from August 10 2001 to May 14 2002,</p>
</div>
<div class="align-right">
<p>I received steroids,</p>
</div>
<div class="align-right">
<p>intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),</p>
</div>
<div class="align-right">
<p>Prednisone,</p>

<div class="align-right">
<p>51 blood tests,</p>

</div>
<div class="align-right">
<p>(wikipedia: Phenoxymethylpenicillin)</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Treatment is still only ever palliative,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>meaning that doctors manage symptoms</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>but do not seek a cure.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My ITP has always been around,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and anytime my immune system is activated,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>it seeks out and destroys my platelets.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Platelets are an essential clotting factor.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Auto-immunity is endlessly alienating and confusing. As a kid, I
understood logically that I ‘was sick’ and might someday ’get better’
but was wholly unequipped to deal with the emotional and psychological
repercussions of living with a body that may or may not be bleeding at
all times.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Think of it this way: my body is a black box and my veins are
Schrödinger’s cat.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The handout also has a very limited definition of “life style” but does
capture the restrictions imposed upon the child. Immunosuppressed to
avoid self-destruction, disallowed bodily contact sports to avoid
potential external dangers. I was an isolated kid, but I don’t mean to
sound down about it all. I turned out alright, but yeah, it sucked at
the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This document provided general information and guidelines for managing
me, the child with ITP. It was intended for adults to have at least a
vague sense of what was Wrong™ with me and adjust their treatment
accordingly. As far as I recall, I never got a handout. Or counselling,
until I sought it out myself 15 years down the line.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It is my intention in this book to vulgarize and translate my experience
of illness in such a way as to be informative and engaging. I am telling
you a story. I want to share what I’ve been through, in the hope that my
words will resonate with others. I am not a doctor, I was a patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In attempting to show the research I do, I may get things wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I ask that you forgive such errors as you notice,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and engage in a dialogue with me.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Thanks to Maman’s record keeping, I have a filing cabinet of my medical
transcripts, letters, general information and the like, which covers
most of my childhood post-diagnosis.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This is where I begin to disentangle it. I am setting out on an
archaeological dig of the medical knowledge that was produced about me.</p>

<p>So many knots in my chest leave me uneasy.</p>

<p>but untangling roots is often more than I can do alone.</p>
<p>I try not to retreat into numbness, with its familiar haze.</p>
<p>When I let myself numb to life, I lose the magic that is: feeling.</p>
<p>Emotions are exhausting, but at least they are true.</p>
<p>I’ve been sick so long that I forget what an effect illness has on life.</p>
<p>Let me be clear, when I say illness, I don’t mean an occasional
cold/flu.</p>
<p>I mean long-term, recurring, full of unknowns</p>
<p>no matter how many test results pile up in a file.</p>
<p>When I speak of illness I mean the ever-present sense of bodily doubt,</p>
<p>of not knowing whether it will ever be possible to trust my body.</p>
<p>Radical Left politics of anti-ableism would have me accept my illness.</p>
<p>My leanings toward a zen worldview would as well.</p>

I scramble for self-preservation only to find that everyone else is
sinking too. No amount of internalized wellness rhetoric changes that my
body is prone to random bouts of self-destruction, that the structures
that guide labour and consumption as they exist today make no
affordances for predictably unpredictable health. I work 40 hours a week

steady paycheck that lets me do more than just survive may be worth it.</p>

<p>I suppose that Medically Speaking, it isn’t.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It had been over 2 years since I last visited with the
gastroenterologist, and our meeting lasted less than 10 minutes. Dr.
Guts looked at my numbers and evinced confusion:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“Your iron is still low,” she said,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“and… your platelets jumped from 19 to 427 last April.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“Yes,” I confirmed, “I rested that month.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“Your platelets shot that high because you…rested?”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“Yes, that’s what I said.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My platelets were low when I checked into the ER in late that one night
in March 2019 due to high fever. I spent the night sitting under
fluorescents in a half-lotus, listening, taking in the noise. My regular
blood doctor was the attendant haematologist, and he upped my regular
meds when he got around to my hallway-bound cot at 7am the next morning.
So in April the meds I was taking everyday were doing their thing, too.
My haematologist and I have a decent working relationship. He’s followed
my case since I was 19, he knows what my body’s up to.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Dr. Guts, the gastroenterologist, I saw for the first time in 2017 when
by her careful hand tubes with cameras insinuated through me to check
whether some part of my large intestine or bowels was bleeding. They
were not. The experience was deeply troubling. Perhaps some of you have
been through this procedure: Drugged to near-total dissociation with
fentanyl, I was out cold for the majority of the invasion. I had a
single moment of lucidity. My oesophagus was occupied by plastic, my
intestine shifting uneasily to accommodate the probe. I was aware of
movement inside me. Not alarmed, not in pain, only aware. My stomach,
distended in odd ways, occupied my attention. I did not see. I knew what
was happening, what I had agreed to. I waited, patiently, comatose. They
found my insides to be positively normal.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Dr. Guts: “After the procedure in 2017,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I prescribed you iron supplement pills.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“Yes,” I acquiesced, “they stopped working.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“They worked for a while,” she points out astutely.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Research has found that oral iron supplement treatments generally take
6-8 months to fix the problem and restore the body’s iron levels. Two
years after the little red pills, my iron levels have generally remained
quite low, my iron-deficiency anaemia without a clear fix. From April to
May 2019, I received iron intravenously.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>That almost did the trick.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Since the original procedure in 2017, I have twice received undiscussed
and unexpected summons for another gastroscopy-endoscopy, in spite of my
doctor confirming that the original examination and accompanying
biopsies yielded no results. Part of me thinks Dr. Guts just really
enjoys performing this particular test.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Until now, I have refused to undergo the procedure again. We’ve
discussed other options, so I remain confused as to why that procedure
was requisitioned again. Yet here we are, December 2019, and tomorrow
they’re checking.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I agreed to this. I’m afraid of the consequences of not following
medical orders. I spend a lot of my time concerned with the
personal/political consequences of ingesting such and such food or media
product. I feel so porous, affected by everything I consume, medicine
included. When it comes to medical orders, I follow them critically.
That is to say, I follow them. I do not presume to know how to balance
my body’s chemical load better than my MDs. I feel how the variety of
medications affect me, but currently lack knowledge about their
biological functioning or the targets we are trying to reach. Even
though I doubt anything will come</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>from this test or the next, I agree.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Because I know this:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>a normal amount of blood platelets is 150’000-300′000 per microliter of
blood,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and my counts in 2019, after 18 blood tests, have been between 9000 and
427’000.</p>
</div>

<div class="hanging">
<p>when I forget to take meds, omit to fill a prescription,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>or otherwise live life counter to medical recommendations,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>was found to be at “a satisfactory 22 mm Hg.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Excellent, I adore being satisfactory.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>What the doctors don’t mention amongst themselves</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>is the impact of this intra-ocular pressure on basic quality of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>IOP causes pain, and when my right eye was in pain,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the signals interfered with the left, the “useful” eye.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I couldn’t focus my sight on anything, concentrate,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>or, god forbid, hold sustained eye contact.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I felt isolated and alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>ITP meant I was barred from most forms of physical activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>IOP meant sleepless nights that bled into fuzzy days and years of ocular
shut-in.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>At school, sitting in a corner, book in hand, my glaucoma turned me into
a Curiosity.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My right eye developed a cloudy white-blue-green colour that I have
grown to love in my adult life. Not so, as a child. From the age of 5,
when I “lost” my vision, until the age of 16 or so, when I had my last
eye surgery, my unseeing eye would regularly keep me up at night in
agony until I passed out from exhaustion.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>When I was little, Maman and I had a routine:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>First, I would scream or whimper, sometime in the evening,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>usually around bedtime, when I was already tired</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and no longer had the capacity to ignore the discomfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Being tired always makes the eye act up, even to this day.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>So, I would make known that I was in pain, one way or another,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and try to smother it in a pillow or a series of cold-compresses.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>IOP pain feels like my eye is going to explode.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It felt like an ever-inflating ball inside my skull.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I couldn’t see out of the offending eye,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>so where sight used to be there was only colourful pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I kind of understood what was going on,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>but that was of little comfort in day-to-day life.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Children have no qualms about</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>pointing, staring, asking intrusive questions,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>venturing patchwork guesses about the nature of someone’s difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I heard everything from</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“your eye grants you oracular powers” (which I like)</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>to “your eye is that way because someone’s cum got stuck in it”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>(which fuelled mountains of internalized homophobia)</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Kids say stupid things, nothing new here.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Still, it’s important for me to acknowledge</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>how physical difference, especially visible difference from others,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>can be deeply distressing as a child.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My visual impairment is a minor disability</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>that has not gotten in the way of most things I attempt to do in life.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Self-effacing caveat aside,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>having a single blind eye</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>made me a target</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>of harassment</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and bullying</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>for years.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sometimes it took the form of a kid hiding around a corner,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>waiting to jump-scare me on my blind side</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and then lording my inability to see over my head at any opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sometimes there were snide comments.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Oftentimes there was no harm meant,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>but I still felt myself ever more distant from my peers</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>as a result of Seeing different and looking different.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">

<div class="hanging">
<p>Anyone with eyes is likely to agree:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>an eye is a very sensitive, delicate ball of goop.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Just as much as eyes are</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>much-vaunted windows to the soul,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>eyes are a means to an end.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap" aria-hidden="true">A</span><span class="lead_word" aria-hidden="true">ll </span><span class="lead_word" aria-hidden="true">the </span><span class="lead_word" aria-hidden="true">letters </span><span class="lead_word" aria-hidden="true">doctors </span>exchanged on the state of my condition
in the first few months following my diagnosis have a few things in
common. The doctors adopt a formal and clinical tone, getting right to
the facts of injury, illness, and treatment. My doctor knows his
intended audience:</p>
<p>Other Doctors.</p>
<p>MD to MD.</p>
<p>Why, then, does each letter stress that I was such a nice boy? How is it
medically relevant to the treatment of my eyes and blood whether a boy
or I’m nice? Getting gendered by medical authority carries weight.
Medical sex, as well as gender presentation, seriously impacts how a
patient is treated by their doctors.</p>
<p>I have to wonder whether, on the flip side of the gender binary, Dr. C
would have referred to me as a nice girl, or added some kind of
diminutive? Nice Little Girl, for good measure? I can only speculate,
but it seems likely enough. The words we use have everything to do with
our environment, and middle-aged men risk carrying subtle hints of
misogyny everywhere they go, including their medical practice.</p>
<p>In the treatment of ITP, I can understand how the possession of a uterus
impacts treatment after menstruation. What I’m struggling to wrap my
head around is why my eye-care specialist felt the need to specify, in
each of his letters, that I was a Nice Boy. There’s an easy enough
explanation: in general, all children get gender assigned, in all walks
of life, in a million contexts where it shouldn’t matter. This is just
one more example of that. Nothing new here. But I’m not satisfied by
that answer.</p>
<p>Maybe the language is less stilted than the more clinical The Patient,
but it is ultimately less accurate to call me a boy than to call me a
patient.</p>
<p>In operation reports, I am The Patient. The function of the documents is
the same, isn’t it? The letters and the reports? Both provide
information about the status of me, Patient/Nice Boy, in order for other
doctors to know how things were going with my condition.</p>
<p>The major difference I can pin down stems from whether or not I was
conscious during the time period referenced in the document. If I was
awake, during a checkup, I was Matthieu-Xavier the Nice Boy. If I was
under anaesthetic, during surgery, I became The Patient.</p>
<p>During routine checkups, I had a voice. I answered questions. Shared how
I felt, whether I was in any pain. During surgery, I had no feeling,
lost all subjectivity. I was asleep. The purpose of our interactions was
fundamentally different. From Nice Boy to Patient all thanks to some
anaesthetic.</p>
<p>At least Patient stands the test of time. I was only a boy because I’d
been told my whole life that I was a boy and didn’t know I had the
option to disagree, to dissent. I was a boy because terms of endearment
like “my little man” have been levelled at me forever. I was a boy
because I got Jurassic Park toys and Hot Wheels and Beyblades and those
are Boy Toys. I was a boy because I had scruffy short hair. I was a nice
boy because I listened to the doctor.</p>
<p>Is the use of Nice Boy a way to show empathy? To acknowledge that I am
not only a collection of symptoms, despite what the present letter would
otherwise have us believe? By acknowledging my niceness, my boyness, the
doctor may be saying:</p>
<p>“This child has a life of some kind</p>
<p>outside our scope of knowledge,</p>
<p>outside of medicine.”</p>
<p>To deem me merely The Patient would have reduced my childhood to
illness, pathology and nothing else.</p>
<p>To be a Nice Boy in my doctor’s letters means he was concerned with my
wellbeing.</p>
<p>I remember the ophthalmology wing at BC Children’s Hospital in 2001.
Those appointments were separate from the ITP checkups. We walked back
and forth from oncology. I was at the hospital almost daily that first
year.</p>
<p>My eye specialist, Dr. C., who wrote this letter, was a competent doctor
and a kind man. Week after week I sat in his examination chair while he
prodded my eyes with ophthalmic instruments and did what he could to
save my sight. He failed of course, but that was no fault of his. The
care proffered by the coalition of doctors and pharmaceutical
conglomerates is a tendril of empire.</p>
<p>The doctors convene conferences on autoimmunity.</p>
<p>I imagine they share stories of our bodies’</p>
<p>dysfunctions over cocktails</p>
<p>and look out at the Adriatic sea</p>
<p>from the hotel bar in Athens.</p>
<p>Does the haematologist foot the bill himself,</p>
<p>or does the institution?</p>
<p>Are patients in attendance?</p>
<p>Physicians are on such a pedestal,</p>
<p>all the better to market their expertise in private practice</p>
<p>with such snappy blog-posts as</p>
<p>“14 ways to cure auto-immune disease”</p>

<p>So on my way home from my job,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>I stopped at the pharmacy and purchased a new syringe</p>

<p>haphazardly around my tiny apartment</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>First, I washed my hands, then I gathered up my supplies.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>1ml SANDOZ Vitamine B12 1000MCG/ML (DIN 00521515)</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>which had cost me 8,37$</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>and had not gone through on the RAMQ public insurance.</p>

<p>Next, generic isopropyl alcohol sterilization pads,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>the 1ml syringe, and a finger-shaped Band-Aid™ for afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I chose the only part of me that has enough fatty tissue,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>in order to avoid injecting too deep, and prepared the injection site.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>As I approached the needle, it brushed up against one of my fingers.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>That was almost enough for me to call it off then and there.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Self-administered shots are nerve-wracking business.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>What if I had compromised the needle’s sterility</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and ended up with blood poisoning?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I took a deep breath, and carried on.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Ultimately unfounded worries.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Before I knew it the needle had been inserted</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and the syringe plunger was waiting for its action.</p>

<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>More deep breathing.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>In: ready yourself.</p>

</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Out: slowly contract your left hand’s thumb so as to inject the B12

<div class="hanging">
<p>Watch it happen in the mirror, hardly feeling,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>caught up in breathing, pushing away the fear.</p>

<p>In certain contexts the Bene Gesserit mantra rings true:</p>

<p><span class="dropcap" aria-hidden="true">I</span><span class="lead_word" aria-hidden="true"> </span><span class="lead_word" aria-hidden="true">saw </span><span class="lead_word" aria-hidden="true">my </span><span class="lead_word" aria-hidden="true">haematologist </span>(blood specialist) recently.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Well, first, I saw a Resident doctor under his tutelage.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This Resident had an air of confidence in her knowledge,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>seemed nervous holding down the clinic.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>As I reported on my recent health and confirmed the information on file,
she took simple notes in neat handwriting. She then asked me to wait
while she went to speak with my doctor. The young Resident returned with
Dr. O, a kindly middle-aged man with whom I have a good working
relationship.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>He commented that I look well, to go along with my numbers, which have
been positive as of late following a tumultuous year. We have the data
to back this up: 18 recent blood tests. Not an an all-time yearly high
for me, but a respectable amount. Dr. O noted that my hair seemed</p>
</div>
<p>especially curly.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“You’re always reinventing yourself.” he quipped.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“Well, I’m young.” I replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>We exchange some pleasant banter. I’m probably one of his younger
patients. He’s been following my case since I was 19, and has seen me go
through a number of phases and changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>When I first met Dr. O in 2015 I was hospitalized. I had recently moved
to Montreal and didn’t have a specialist yet. It was my second semester
of university, I had overworked myself and caught influenza. He got me
sorted out.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>That year, I was transfused a few rounds of Intravenous Immunoglobulin
(IVIG), which got my platelets to shoot up briefly before plummeting
again. There’s a lot to be said about this drug, but that’s for later.
For now, suffice to mention that it’s a common treatment for ITP and
other medical conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Later that same year, Dr. O got me on a more recent medication, which I
still take now (as of writing, in early 2020). Presently, I am
prescribed 75mg of Revolade®, manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Canada Inc. This medication’s active component is “eltrombopag”, which
is a “thrombopoietin receptor agonist.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I have been taking this medication at varied dosages since mid-2015. Its
purpose is to act as a productivity coach for my bone marrow, urging it
to produce more blood platelets. The pills come in 25, 50, or 75mg
compositions of different colours.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I speculate that the pills are different colours because it makes them
easily identifiable on the factory floor, so that a 50mg pill has a
rather slim chance of finding itself in a packet of 25mg pills.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In fact, I have never seen such a mixup, so I suppose their system is
working. No, mixups in dosage have always come from human error on my
end. I’m pretty good about remembering to take my meds now. It’s baked
into my daily routine, but sometimes I’ll forget.</p>

<p>I’ll be out of the house with plans to</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>stay elsewhere overnight, and didn’t bring my pills.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Or I waited too long before calling the pharmacy</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>to renew, so I’ve got none left,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and it’s Saturday right now,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and the pharmacy doesn’t get any deliveries on Sunday,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>so they won’t have my Revolade until Monday</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>because it’s a special order.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In 5 years, they’ve never just happened to already have it in stock.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Again, I’m not certain why that is, but can venture a guess</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>that I’m one of very few, if not the only person</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>around here who’s got it prescribed.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>There’s also the matter of cost,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>without the RAMQ</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>or private insurance</p>

</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>About 4500$ per 28 days’ supply.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Thankfully, a yearly bureaucratic process grants me access with minimal
monetary expense. If Revolade were not currently my only viable option,
I would not be on this drug. Its side-effects &amp; precautions sheet,
included in every box, is the size of a poster, with one side in english
and the other in french. Some potential side-effects include: cataracts.
I can’t wrap my head around that one. The prospect of developing
cataracts, the implication of going “totally blind”, at the age of
20-something, is not appealing. In practice, that’s not remotely likely
to happen, so I keep taking the drug.</p>

<p>When I showed a friend some of these writings early on, they said:</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Picturing you as a protagonist on some wild life ride helps me digest
the fact that everything you’re experiencing is real and at times
scary. I think I would worry far too much otherwise. I hope your
newsletter allows you to experience some form of escapism, if only for
a few fleeting moments. How could you not, with all that imagery?</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I replied:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Dear Friend, this is not for me a form of escapism.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Lately, I’ve been experiencing feelings that I don’t yet have the right
language to describe. Some of what I feel is vigour, passion, lust,
sorrow, loss. My body feels sore but good, which is an unusual
combination for me. I feel connected to the world yet distant. Perhaps
most importantly, I feel angrythat the world is so many of the ways that
it is right now. I feel possessed by rage, which, I’m beginning to
realize is at the root of how I choose to be in the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I feel as though the quote-unquote “sickness” that has shaped my life is
little more than a cultural fiction. I do not mean narrative fiction
with political themes. Someone reading a novel or a story can close the
book and leave the realm of fiction behind. There is an important
difference between cultural fiction and narrative fiction.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Cultural fiction is the realm of lived experience formed by all our
received notions of what is and is not possible in reality. It feels as
though the words I’ve used to describe myself over the course of my life
are becoming increasingly senseless. Cultural fiction is the language I
learned to use to identify myself with people, groups, categories. Name,
sex, gender, political status.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>“How about we all go around and introduce ourselves?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Let’s do names, pronouns,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and anything else you feel like sharing.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>All of these words are useful short-hand for use on official documents.
For many people whose legal identity markers differ in ways from mine,
these words are necessary for survival, for recognition and access to
essential community and services. These Words are not identity. I
believe there is no essential identity, only a shifting set of
relations, many of which determine social-political status. I use words
regularly in order to access medication, credit, lodging; they remain
political fictions. The same system which designates me as Male leads to
my diagnosis as Chronically Ill, a nice boy. Politically, I am my
“deficient” immune system as much as I am a male of legal voting age. In
actuality, I am not Matthieu-Xavier Marin, though that is the name that
appears on my passport. I echo here Paul B. Preciado’s words:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am not a man and I am not a woman and I am not heterosexual I am not
homosexual I am not bisexual. I am a dissident of the sex-gender system.
I am the multiplicity of the cosmos trapped in a binary political and
epistemological system.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>For me, being trans is being sick and being sick is being trans. I do
not seek medical/legal transition. My gender (or lack thereof) and my
political identity are as real as my illness. My body is already the
product of modern medicine, official Womanhood does not call out to me.
My body has been the blood of unknown thousands worldwide, it was the
Penicillin I took for over a decade, and is the anti-haemorrhage pills I
take every day now. I do not want or need synthetic estrogen to cease
being Male, I have long since been in transition. My body has been in
revolt against the sex-gender system from the moment my immune system
went haywire and began attacking its host: Me.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The moment a twist of fate blinded one of my eyes I was no longer the
Male fiction which was assigned to me at birth, I was (and am) A
Patient. And now, I am learning how to cope with the dis-identification
from masculinity, sickness, and health. There is no escaping these
fictions which shape my body and yours. Every time I go to a clinic I
reaffirm the fiction that is Matthieu-Xavier Marin, the fiction of
masculinity, the fiction of Immune Thrombocytopenia, all in order to
receive treatment which increases my quality of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>When the power to withhold treatment may be so quickly brandished, I act
counter to my beliefs. If medicine could treat bodies without gendering
them, if it were possible to be considered a sovereign political subject
without necessarily being M or F, millions of people would not share my
problem. In the current binary system, it is not possible. Honestly, not
undergoing Official Transition is a form of harm reduction, of not
making more friction for myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In naming these things as fiction, I do not deny their material reality.
But new fictions must be invented in order to account for the
multiplicity of experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I write it in order to speak. I am writing to engage in dialogue. I am
writing with others to redefine what is possible, in order to bring new
versions of myself into existence. This is an enactment of who I am in
the world. It is my way of playing with language until I can find out
how to describe and share what my reality consists of. I am speaking the
death of my sick human body, and of the fictions which have shaped my
worlds, in all the complexity that entails. All this, in order to better
imagine new possibilities for existing with each other.</p>

<p>Dear Dr. B, RE:M-X MARIN.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Further to my previous letter regarding this nice little boy, we have
continued to follow him up on a weekly basis. Matthew has becomes very
light shy. His examination is quite difficult as a result. Slit lamp
examination on the right shows profound corneal staining which has
worsened since he had a further bleed inside the right eye. On the
left sight, the slit lamp examination is difficult.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was able to obtain a good view of his cornea, anterior
chamber, iris, lens and anterior vitreous. There is no suggestion of
ocular inflammation whatsoever. His corneal surface is intact and
there is no conjunctival inflammation either. I cannot account for
Matthew’s symptoms of photophobia. I do not think this is evidence of
sympathetic ophthalmia. There is a potential risk of this in view of
his past history. I have suggested that he continue to use the topical
Voltaren and Prednisolone 1% drops previously prescribed to the right
eye and that he re-attend in three weeks. I would like to see him
sooner if his symptomatology worsens.</p>
<p>Kindest regards.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>According to Wikipedia community editors, Photophobia is an abnormal
intolerance to visual perception of light. It is an experience of
discomfort or pain to the eyes due to light exposure or physical
sensitivity. When my eye doctor diagnosed my photophobia, they were
basing themselves on how I reacted to the bright directional lights used
for examination.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The word photophobia can also mean morbid fear of cameras or seeing.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It is aversion, an impulse to recoil from looking.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In my regular life, photophobic days are when I won’t make eye contact,
leaving the house is less likely to happen, and I can’t concentrate on
anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Photophobia is not unlike a migraine. It’s kinda like seeing multicolour
TV static on those old bunny-ear sets. Over the years, I had a few eye
surgeries to diminish eye-ball pressure. Back when the pressure was
extremely high, I’d have photophobic days a lot. Lately it’s uncommon.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The only cause I’ve been able to pinpoint for photophobia in my adult
life is fatigue. When I am tired, my eyes hurt. A straightforward
formula. Following months working full-time at a computer, my tolerance
to screens has diminished significantly, so I rarely watch TV anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>When my eyes are in pain, I use them differently. I’m not equipped for
navigating life without sight, I lack practice. Still, my eyes ask that
I take a break from staring into the world, and learn other ways of
understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How about another reading of photophobia: not as pathological aversion
to sight, but as revolt against vision by Blindness, as “blind gain.” I
am inspired by the d/Deaf studies narration of deaf gain rather than
hearing loss. Deafness and Blindness have been thought of as framing
experience. Okay. Whose frame? Who’s doing this framing?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Framing is a partial, banal, and unimaginative metaphor about sight. It
restricts possibilities outside of “useful vision” by constructing
borders around possibilities for constellation. “Looking” appears as
just a tool for knowledge. Unfortunately, this tool is weaponized.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sight is a basis of pathology: it creates normality, symptoms.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sight bores into reality, to prove it can be seen.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Vision is a scope for framing reality in your sights, making reality a
visible entity open to calculation and marketing. I’m so tired of being
marketed at. Vision is predatory, capturing images for language to
narrow down by force. Looking has been used to choose the visible and
construct the invisible. It is mobilized to create fear.</p>

<p>Let’s understand symptoms of vision loss as blind gain,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>in a conscious shift away from the regime of vision.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Blind gain is looking’s move beyond instrumental sight.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Blind gain surpasses sight in order to reveal</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>an invisible present within the ongoing moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Blind gain is the feeling that we have much to learn from sightlessness.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It is a sensitivity to the harms enacted by vision.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It is a category for imagining beyond sight.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It is an awareness that a shift in perception is a good thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My blindness is always changing.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How come I was told all my life that I had lost vision,</p>
</div>
<p>rather than gained blindness?</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Some summer days, my blind eye can take the full brunt of the sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Other days, a dim room or my phone’s screen</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>are enough to force both my eyes closed in defence against the light,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>so vision can’t really look at anything either.</p>

<p>These are those photophobic days, when blindness revolts.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>“Framing” so much as the birds we may hear or the earth we lay on.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Verily, enframing is sight’s doing, vision’s call to arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Framing restricts fields of experience, like we have long penned
animals:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>to keep them in sight, under relative control.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Frames are borders: geometric and geographic,</p>
</div>
<p>imposed by the Eye’s vision.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Framing establishes a relationship of domination</p>
</div>
<p>between parties meeting upon the field.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Given that sight is essentially limited, it seeks unseen territories</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>in order to deepen, widen, and stratify its expanse.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sight is a tool, wielded by Power, so that previously-unseen</p>

<p>Sight is a barometer of what is allowed within or without,</p>

<p>as human or other, white or other,</p>

<p>man or other, straight or other, living or dead.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Sight lacks nuance, even in its waning imperial rule.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sight is the trouble we stay with even while learning about
alternatives.</p>

<p>We’re stuck with it, as seers or seen and often as both. </p>

</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Blind gain is an unframing, an unseeing, a re-realizing without borders,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>When sickness and medicine come together, they create illness. Living
well with an ever-present awareness that sickness exists is a learned
practice. I learned as I grew up in-and-out of hospitals.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am reading The Immune System, A Very Short Introduction, because I do
not understand how how the body’s biology works. I’m finding this
Introduction scientifically informative, but I’ve got a bone to pick
with its language.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>As an example, the book’s metaphor for viral infection is of “hijacking”
cells. To me, that language implies that our cells are private property
being commandeered by a virus and driven off course towards doom. This
rhetoric of the body seems to make our own bodies unworthy of trust.
They must be controlled, bridled like wild horses.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Different bodies have different claims to ownership, and enact varying
degrees of violent repression</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>to maintain ownership over the cells of other bodies. For a Citizen in
21st century so-called-canada, which I am, the ownership-bid is divided
up in as many parts as there are calls for us to work productively, or
encouragements to consume “freely” the fruits of global economic
production shipped to our northern land. This is a soft repression.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In Illness as Metaphor, Susan Sontag dissects the literature concerning
Tuberculosis and Cancer. Pervasive disease of the 18-20th centuries. She
finds that a recurring metaphor for Turberculosis is “consumption.”
Consumption is defined here as a manner of appearing ill. It was
envisioned glamorously. Many aristocrats adorned themselves
“consumptively.” Tuberculosis was fashionable.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>For others in Sontag’s analysis, consumption was viewed as a habit to be
broken. In other words: the malady of Tuberculosis itself was a habit.
In all cases, Sontag’s metaphors of illness seem concerned with the
perception of illness in others, with its representation after the fact,
not with the lived reality of sickness.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sontag herself had 3 cancers, and died with the third. She never
published auto-biographical texts in her life. But I took a detour to
read her early journals, 1947-1963. Poor Susan had no grasp on her
emotions. She is ruled by them even as she parses out the intellectual
intricacies of life. These journals take us from ages 16-30 or so. From
auditing classes at Berkeley, through marriage, early years of her child
David, bohemia in Paris, and life as a young writer in NYC. She’s
struggling throughout with How to Love, Be a Jew, Be a Writer. She reads
widely and ceaselessly. Voraciously considers her culture, lives it. All
the while, the journals are precipitously self-conscious. “How do I
exist?” A perpetual reflexive self-analysis. Relentless. Sontag never
once relaxed in all these 15 years. Her love affairs all strike me as
childish. Why? She is entrapped, stuck in co-dependency. She admits in
the 60s that she feels rarely able to be alone, that she feels
un-self-sufficient. She vampirized her lovers. No doubt some of that was
mutual, but as a reader I saw only S.S’ view. As a reader indeed, the
experience was thrilling. The sheer intimacy of it. I dreamt of her last
night.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Somehow, the ill are read as on their way to death’s door. Sontag’s book
was reviewed as an exhilarating “literary” performance, in spite of her
explicit point that “illness” is not a metaphor. She was wrong. Susan
would have us regard illness in a “healthy” way “purified” of metaphoric
thinking. Simultaneously, she enforces borders between “Kingdoms of
health and ill.” It seems that, to Sontag, illness broke life into a
binary Good and Bad. 40 years later, those alleged borders are radically
porous. Each of us harbours a near-constant awareness that at any moment
we may fall ill and be rendered dependent on others for our ability to
consume. Sickness demands that we trust the people around us.</p>

<p>What does it mean, to trust?</p>

<p>let alone others,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>when a virus is pandemic?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How could we possibly trust,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>when we understand viral infection as an attack,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>a virus as a combatant?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>When we’re always on the defence, shields raised?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Instead of virus as hijacker, what about the virus as teacher?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>From a virus, a host body learns to develop anti-bodies with which to
eliminate the infection.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>How many of us now are now unsure what to do with our days,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>when we can hardly produce or consume?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How many of us feel guilty?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This moment is an opportunity to learn other ways</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>of using time and resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How many of us are afraid?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How can we defend ourselves against the metaphors of illness and viral
infection at once?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Illness is an idea, and it is shaped by how we invoke the word.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Illness is the stress, fear, restlessness, guilt, and unease we are
feeling.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Illness is why many of us don’t know what to make of their days.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sickness as a way of life is an ecology of presence,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>an acceptance of the covenant between our bodies and the earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>We alive now are not any more guilty for pandemic than climate change,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>but we must be responsible for how we respond to both and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Populations have been violently dispossessed of responsibility by the
dominant order of things,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and we are at grips to reclaim our presence on the living earth we
inhabit.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Pandemic may serve as disillusionment within apocalypse.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>We are here. Not morally or legally bound to responsibility,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>but filled with desire to promote renewal, reciprocity, and respect.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This moment is so full of embodied potentials.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Time flows by. Saturdays, I am not turning on my phone or computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How much physical isolation is by design? How are ‘safety’ and
‘productivity’ linked?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Pandemic is globally a herald for martial law. Public safety restricts
interpersonal contact to forms dictated by law so that ‘unsafe’ actions
may be limited. Organizing mass physical protest seems unthinkable when
pandemic is rampant. The imposition of public safety over history has
forced acts of public revolt to assume non-violent forms. “Peaceful
protest.” With increased surveillance came increased reliance on
subterfuge. There was a move away from violent uprising toward
ideological battle. Peoples were dispossessed of arms so that power may
keep them. The disarmament of society and the militarization of policing
co-operate with the word of law to ensure “safety.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>We rely on ideas to keep us safe rather than the bodies we inhabit, so
we have no more arms with which to care for ourselves. How can we take
responsibility if no one has taught us how? It is a matter of learning
how to be sick.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sickness is a call to collective action.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sickness is what families, communities, and affinity groups come
together to care for.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Sickness is a way of life.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Illness is sickness’ ethic reduced to a pathology.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Illness is a means to shrug off personal responsibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It removes us from the lived reality of sickness all around.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My sickness is real enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Real, in that doctors have a name for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>A set of treatments. An agreed-upon scale of severity.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Real in fact because it is named, and quantifiable.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Little guesswork remains, there are the facts, the diagnosis.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Illness, still, is obscene.</p>

<p>In conversation, I notice people seem afraid to utter the word pandemic.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>I am selfish. I acknowledge that within my own life, my wellbeing comes
first. It is by keeping myself alive that I can best support others.
Those I love, who turn to me for support, I want to be there for them.
If I do not do what I must in order to feel good and whole within
myself, I cannot sustainably support others. Our lives, intertwined, I
do not wish them extirpated, no matter what the government regulations
stipulate. I want to enmesh us further, to know what comes of closeness.
To do this, we must learn when to say ‘No. Enough. Not right now.’</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This is not up to authority to determine, it is individual
responsibility. So long as I am able, I will turn this ability into
good. I am no better or worse than anyone else. Each of us is here, and
learning what that means. How can anyone possibly presume to know what’s
best for another person? We all have different answers. I tend my own
garden and share the harvest. I strive to glean carefully what each
world-fragment has to share. To recognize and shed prejudice, gather
each thing on its own as a whole part of the larger universe.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Daily I take stock of my capacity. Variability and fluctuation unlike
ever before. Or perhaps I’m just more perceptive. I’ve been in a more
personally tumultuous state before. Now, the tumult is outside. My inner
life is relatively calm. I notice its intricacies in more detail, it is
with both apprehension and excitement that I write down my dreams. I aim
to Stop expecting a text back. Stop demanding a response. Each of us is
overwhelmed by demands on our attention. Forget any notion that you are
more important than any one else. I am not any more important than
anyone else, don’t get back to me if you don’t have the energy, and
please do not feel guilty. Everyone on earth, without exception, is part
of what is underway ever after this state of limbo.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Share what matters to you, far and wide, regardless of expectation. Make
no demands on the energy of others unbidden, but do not be afraid to
share. What is it that is keeping you going right now? No matter how
benign, someone else empathizes. Our ideas must flow with compassion. We
feel the way together.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How do I feel? I feel my feet cocooned in thin socks, intimately
familiar with the old wood floor. I know the floor’s dips and inclines,
for having stood alone with it. I feel my window facing 120 degrees SE,
if my dusty old compass is to be believed. I feel the sun’s rays rising
through the southeasterly portal. I’ve cracked it open, so I’m stroked
by spring breeze and I hear spring sound. I feel excitement and
determination, as I focus on my projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I feel the air I breathe, and I feel the tightness of anxiety in my
lungs.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I feel both my eyes distinct from one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I feel the nerves sprouting from the skull’s base, connecting me.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I see the sun on my skin and sense pleasant warmth.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I bear a light ache in my heart as sad thoughts of distant separation
come to mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I pause, and read a paragraph from Phèdre aloud to myself.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Unable to digest more than that at once, I lay the book back down on my
desk.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Plato’s Socrates is opposed to allegorical interpretation of the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Following the Oracle at Delphi’s guidance, he chooses to focus on
learning himself.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>And who do I presume to be? One whose voice rings clear within the
depths of my own flesh. A body is anything but transparent, I contain
far more than the sum of my parts. Each action I take for my own
wellbeing drives me forward toward a higher version of myself.
Completing even the most benign tasks is part of the puzzle. Self-care
is primordial. I love this world. I love existing with/in it. I love its
simplicity and complexities. The wellspring of sensation runs deeper
than I can ever know. All my efforts to feel deeply spiral together,
sharper and deeper, plunging my body into itself. I leave aside
preconceptions about what it is possible for me to feel, and take
new/familiar sensations as they come, not disbelieving my own grasp of
reality. Why should I ever tell myself a feeling is false? I am blessed
with an honest body, one which attempts no trickery. It is with time and
patience that I learn the grammar of sensation. There is no formula for
love, there is only acknowledgement of its possibility and dedication to
its practice. Love is a choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Inner life is inherently true, there is no contradicting solipsistic
experience. Inner life risks becoming false when it butts up against the
outer world and its many contradictions, yet the truth of inner life
does not make it serene. Truth can be chaos, hurt, confusion. It is
through acceptance that I begin to make sense of my truth. Facing
unpleasant truth is difficult. It’s much simpler to focus only on
positives, to live as though everything ought to be pleasurable all the
time. Even now, there are so many positives.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Focusing on pain is a necessary means of better understanding my place
in the world, my relationship to my past, my needs in the present, and
my desire for a future. Not those material wants which lend themselves
to a certain lifestyle, but the needs of which drive me.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>So many questions from disparate sources with ongoing answers: What is
the capacity for violence? What do we harness, to grow in power? Who are
we? How can we be meaningfully frightened? What happens when the
temporarily-able-bodied, the not-ill, begin to roam again? What is the
value of escape in living with presence? How do we balance Here+Now with
Then+There in order to survive pandemic’s emotional toll? What is it
about stories of unreal proportions that feel so liberating?</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Storytelling is freedom-making. The reading of stories is a cure for
loneliness and it is an amnesiac. Reading is a matter of embodying the
reality suggested in the text. There is a great beauty in this temporary
commandeering of memory. Give up on courage, and escape. How wonderful,
that I might ignore human suffering for a time, and empathize with
narrative fiction instead. Draped in its own fictions, waking life hurts
me to bear. So much is wrong and so much is uncertain. In re-reading a
familiar story, I can suspend my knowledge of how much I do not know
here and now, to indulge in knowing some future, and strap into the
tumult leading up to an ending.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>For there is an end, even to 3000 page sagas. The printed page is
floriously static. It does not risk slipping into new terrifying realms
of as-yet-unimagined unknowns. I have picked a narrative I know, I am
familiar with the arc upon which I will fly. And there, escaping into
other identities, I find comfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>There is no going back to normal.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Normal?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Normal as in healthy?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>There can be no going back because what pandemic reveals is the fiction
of health. We have never been healthy. Health is a story woven by
institutional power in order to create a reality in which it is possible
to negate certain lives on the basis of abnormality or pathology.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Pandemic extends the logic of medicalization to everyone. Prevention is
currently the treatment preached by the government of canada, so that we
may slow the spread of COVID-19 and not overwhelm our public healthcare
infrastructure. The infrastructure relies on previous expectations of
how many might fall ill at a given time, and the built environment
reflects that calculus. The status of illness in society is undergoing
radical change, as we all now may be sick. What does it mean to be
considerate of fellow humans, living in close quarters?</p>

play in the couple hours waiting for test results before the doctor’s
visit. I think I found it because it was popular on Miniclip. The
soundtrack, the world, the slow pace; Runescape is a waiting game. I
remember discovering my player character’s limits heading West, followed
by an in-game pal. “Where are we going?” “To find the elves.” —only,
the elves are pay-walled. Eventually, I convinced Maman to pay my
membership fee, but I never progressed through to the elven settlement.
A simple structure: Quests, levels, trading, combat. Goals to reach.
Power to gain. Every attainment felt hard-earned in its reward. The

a nostalgia trip.</p>

<p>The point-and-click adventure in waiting. Waiting for the trees to grow.
Waiting for adversaries to spawn, waiting for mineral ore to appear in
the rocks. RS’ world is scaled up to a speed that keeps players waiting,
but not too long. Not so long that progress feels halted. Cycles are
quick enough for us to sit at the computer with baited breath, eagerly
awaiting the next clic. And what’s more, it a resource is too crowded, a
hundred parallel worlds are available.</p>

productive. No personal growth, no professional development, no

<p>Foreground of verdant field leading up to a large wooden cabin
overlooking a hill, with bright green window shutters open but windows
closed and white curtains pulled. Further afield on the other side of
a second grassy hill, dense forest hugs the mountain slopes partially
lit by sun as cloud-shade cuts across. Background of mountainous peaks
sparsely wooded against cloudy sky of cotton-candy clouds.</p>

<p>I finished Sontag and decided to keep taking pictures</p>

<p>because that seemed like a worthy endeavour.</p>

</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Back at the ER the nice doctor prescribes me morphine</p>

<p>Other people breathe nearby. I wonder where they’ve been recently.</p>

<p>How many of them bring a hospital’s airspace with them to the park?</p>

<p>making the wind visible for a moment,</p>

<p>inhale and exhale with the world atmosphere.</p>

<p>Wind catches my pores</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>carries my body dust along with each of yours</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>so we conspire regardless of distance,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>bridging vast expanses across nothingness</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>in order to be together.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I live very far from the front lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I don’t know what it’s like to live with combat nearby.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>All I know of such places has come to me through images videos words,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>most of my senses are spared the ample truth: the smells, the shock.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I know only a fantasy, fictitious war.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Yet war and I share an atmosphere.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>We breathe within one another.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My breath whispers: How simple, inhale exhale over again</p>
</div>
<p>the first to last thing we’ll ever do.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It’s the repetition that counts, one breath is nothing for the body, we
need air uncounted yet we account for a chemical regime, a specialized
diet of far more than oxygen which is poison anyway in overdose. The air
we share is a floating, transparent pharmacy not-so-carefully
calibrated, and precisely weaponized.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Please welcome the medics wherever there is fighting.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>What is there to gain from the veritable assault on human sensory
capacity, from mass death? I desire counter-offensive measures, but who
doesn’t? Anyone whose ever been hurt has tried retaliation, tried
hurting back. Lately my reading has taken me into potential histories
where men still wreak havoc, but others resist.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The air we share is risky, so we determine how much risk we’re willing
to handle at a given moment. I conspire to emit air which filters out
suffering and positively impact any brief encounter. I share the results
with the inevitable passersby no matter which precautions we take. I
wear a mask in public indoors and in close quarters but have given up on
masking myself for a stroll to the park.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My body is trying its best with what it knows of the long-winded lie
that is that there is self and there is other. I trust the precautions I
am taking are enough for me and those I interact with. I trust the air
with my immune system. But I do not trust my body to visit a hospital
right now. I am angry that it has to be this way, and I am scared. I do
not know what happens to my body when the numbers stop determining how
it exists, but I do not want to measure the passing of time with numbers
and test results.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My partner brings their world to me and we share stories whispering back
and forth of then there here now conspiring liquid atmospheric
coalitions brewing. Limbo feels longer and shorter every single day.
Breathing is a reminder of life as well as a way of giving thanks. Over
facebook messenger I ask my estranged father what worries him right now.
How many people will die, are dying, he says.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I choose to continue sharing air. Circumstances may make that difficult
or impossible. I choose this consciously, so I do not bow before
inevitability. The inevitable does not rule me. Why should it? I treat
those inevitabilities I have learned as parts of the air and blood
streams.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Touch screams, loud, when the body feels unknown skin. Brushed up
against a cashier’s hand as they hand me a receipt, their mouth beyond
the counter’s plastic shielding. Our breaths shouldn’t mingle,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I’m wearing a mask and hopefully they are too. Surface boundaries are
tricky. Skin keeps the blood in, but it doesn’t keep the world out.
Atunement to lived bodies has shifted.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Stating the obvious helps me stay grounded I guess,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I think it’s because I’m used to my life-force being a numbers game.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>You know, like stats in an RPG.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Trying to min-max numbers to attain optimal efficiency.</p>

<p>Observing my own arms the veins are hills and tunnels. They bulge and
recess in turn. It’s commonplace for a nurse in a talkative mood to
comment on their quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Expert appraisal has it: my veins are ripe for harvest.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Not that any of us are too eager.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Nurses are labouring, sticking needles into veins</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>for days on end.</p>

<p>Most nurses are highly skilled at this task.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It barely hurts. Commendable.</p>

<p>I’m trying to imagine my own blood.</p>

<p>Blood is a form of gravity.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>I’ll go back to the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The first blood test I remember came soon after blind gain.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I was 5 years old at British Columbia Children’s hospital.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The blood draw clinic was a couple floors up from the hospital lobby.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The lobby had this massive plastic tree in it. Like 3 stories tall.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>We took the elevator up and upon exit there were a series of signs to
follow.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>All the walls on this level were painted sky blue<br/>
and decorated with flying creatures, bears in aeroplanes,<br/>
clouds rainbows sunshine you know, the usual hospital festivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hanging">
<p>So we follow the party to the clinic.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Waiting room was pretty small, maybe 40 chairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Blue walls. A TV somewhere in the corner.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Pulp magazines for parents to pretend-read.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Toys laid out on a table.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Arrival and check-in, a little window in the wall</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>next to a door through which we’d soon pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>We, being myself, Maman,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the other kids and parents waiting.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The first time, I just sat there</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>not cognizant of what was about to happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My feet didn’t reach the floor</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>maybe my legs were too short or the chair’s too long.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Swung back-forth in ignorant anticipation or maybe simple boredom.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Waiting rooms used to elicit boredom for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I probably stared at the television,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the best way to forget a body before smartphones.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I’ve noticed that most hospital waiting rooms</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>don’t have TV shows on anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>And they don’t call people out by name.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Maybe in the children’s hospitals they still do.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>At the CHUM the teevees just have numbers on them</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and every time the numbers change there’s a Ding</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>so everyone looks up</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>only to dash the patient hopes of all</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>except one bored soul whose turn it finally is.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Anyway at BC children’s in 2001</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>they called me by name and we passed into the back room,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>through a doorway, and then another,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>each room lined with stations</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>having all the fixings needed for sanitary</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>blood sample harvest.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I’m led to the deepest section</p>

<p>of blue-walled-room and sat in a too-big LUMEX</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>designed for maximum clinical comfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It dawns on me why we’re here.</p>

<p>Assume that blood itself exists in superposition</p>

<p>A mode of transition, transportation,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>transmission, diffraction.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>In the dirt, blood learns what comes of experimentation.</p>

<p>Cela serait une grave erreur de penser que les histoires que chuchotent
le sang sont sans conflits. Le sang de la mère française-anglaise, du

<p>They’ve been working on adding a third even taller wing to the CHUM. In
the waiting room I always look down at the progress. Almost done now.
Not just another hole in the ground.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I used to get my blood tests done at Notre-Dame, an old old hospital on
Sherbrooke, opened in 1880. The CHUM, built in 2017, has another high
capacity blood-draw clinic on the main floor of D-wing, but I’ve never
sat there in that glass box within the heart of the skyscraper complex
with no view outside for patients. For some reason I take the elevator
to Oncology.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Once though I stayed overnight at the Nouveau-CHUM in an ER hallway on a
cot under fluorescents. It was mid-march of 2019. I sat in receptive
silence, half-lotus, eyes closed, listening, not sleeping. Notice, the
overworked nurses are torn between the desire to provide comfort and the
expectation of staying back, respecting the distance imposed by pain, by
sickness. How does it feel to have disease constantly on your mind?
Every conversation I’ve had in the past week has either been about
illness or violence.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In the morning my managing haematologist was on duty and came to see me
at bedside.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I said I’m fine.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Platelets, also called thrombocytes,</p>

<p>The circulatory system is a series of veinous corridors,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>The lightest pressure might bruise and the lightest scrape might tear.</p>

<p>Primary symptoms are: excessive bruising, bruising in excess of what one
would’ve expected for the amount of trauma, or bruises that are totally
unexplained.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>When my daily life is asymptomatic, the blood work makes sure to rectify
the notion that everything is normal. Platelet counts outside the norm
have been my everyday for 19 years. I wonder whether we’ll get to stop
counting anytime soon?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Internal bleeding’s a slow dissolving of veinous layers melding into a
contiguous ocean of blood. Carefully mapped out roads falling into
disarray as in-betweens flood. Microscopic terror as a shortage of
platelets leads to tidal waves overcoming the sea walls under
maintained, decimated by an overzealous team of white blood cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>If this shows up to the naked eye at all, it’s usually as ‘petechiae’;
tiny red pinpoints in the skin, little red-blue dots along the arms, the
legs, around the groin. Mini-bruises.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Even invisible illness is subject to sight. Can we stop counting anytime
soon? Put blood under a microscope and find out just how its balance
turns out. Break it down into categories for testing, count out with
frightening exactitude just how much of this that and whatever else my
body happened to contain at 7:32am on August 25th, 2020.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My haematologist’s job is precisely to make sense of the clinical
minutiae contained within blood. Logic takes a crack at making sense of
our lifeblood, and I can’t help but laugh.</p>

<p>It’s time I got out of here.</p>

stock of bodily anxieties to integrate and loosen the tensions that have

enough on its own to dislodge the stone of sense-memory in your chest.
Stone which holds a past as yet unknown to our waking mind. Sitting may
reveal some of your story, doubtful whether a clear flow will be made to
pass only by bringing attention to the spot. Maybe with many months and
years. Meditation must not be undertaken with an end goal. Circling some
imaginary end turns the practice into a chore rather than a steady
devotion. Not unlike caring for and maintaining friendships.</p>

<p>My dreams lately have been about learning, workshopping, being taught by
many teachers. I hear that when the student is ready, the teachers
appear. I believe my mystery school is in my unconscious. There, and
also on the internet, in the texts. I want to live a mystical life, a
magical life, a mysterious life, an enchanted life, a godly life, a
daoist life, a natural life, a simple life, a good life.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>And I wonder, what does that mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Love and Joy and Sex and Compassion and Strategy and Ritual and Passages
and Thinking and Speaking and Birthing and Decaying and Growing and
Sowing and Reaping and Listening and Singing and Shouting and Seeing and
Freezing and Heating. No deficiency and no excess. Always cycling back.</p>

<p>Imperfection reigns here. Amidst confusion, I breathe in out deep as
ever possible but I feel bloated, weighed down by the unknowns. Why is
my body this way? How did it come to be? What can I do? Do the
not-doing, says the Dao. Therein lies a key, for certain. Wu Wei helps
me glean new insight, new possibilities. Ever a quest for such avenues
as yet unexplored.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This way or that? A new path or old? Am I here for myself or for
another? Are we together or apart? I’ve never ceased exploring, all I
can say is that rational sense is overrated. I don’t want your logic,
your boxes. But I’m trying to understand how they work.</p>

<p>Yesterday a bruise appeared spontaneously on my right hand ring finger
while I walked to Mamie’s. I am accepting the efficacy of medicine, I
suppose. I am not going to let my body self-destruct while I scramble
for alternatives. No, I will instead find safe, stable ground from which
to carry on. This decision feels like failure, like admitting defeat.</p>

<p>Auto-immunity tells me the world is toxic, the body rebels, and I must
respond in the ways that best assure my quality of life. I am saddened

I so opposed to medicine or to profit? Have I not been treated well? Why
fight?</p>

<p>I want to collaborate with the chemistry activating my bone marrow.
Thank you, Pharmacy, for making it possible that a small daily pill lead
to the generation of more numerous blood platelets. Indeed, such
precision is miraculous and ought not be shunned outright. This return
to treatment is not failure, it is a testament to the non-linearity of
healing. I now have a simple confirmation and perhaps that is what I
sought.</p>

<p>The summer before first grade there was a heatwave in QC City. Maman was
looking for a job, for a place to live, for a school. I was going to
day-camp. I’d been sick/blind nearly a year. We left Vancouver to be
closer to family, to save money. First week of camp I got up the courage
to stay overnight with the other kids. First day of first grade I didn’t
go to school because Maman couldn’t bring me. Instead my sitter, some
college student, asked me what I wanted to do that day. Movies or
museums? Easy choice, museums. The oldest colonial city on Turtle Island
has excellently stocked imperial showrooms, no doubt.</p>

<p>In The Argonauts, Maggie Nelson’s third-party account of their child

This is an example of an adulthood shrug, Maggie’s ignoring the

traumatic?</p>

palliative effect of (mostly) maintaining my body’s platelet counts

<p>Calls to productivity are best ignored outright. A diagnosis of
autoimmunity blames the individual bodyfor shortcomings in the world.
Medicine refuses to acknowledge that 24/7 lives of submission to capital
are inherently sick demand, and thus turns suffering inward, as though
every doctor were Nietzsche diagnosing the Christians. When medicine
speaks of auto-immunity it does not mean a body evoking demands to
attention. No, the body becomes the enemy.</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I suppose I am in search of a cure. That’s the ‘reward’ around which
I’ve been orienting my life, my striving. Unconsciously. Would it be
better to seek cure consciously? Or to strive for acceptance and
reconciliation with what is?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I love this flesh; it is all I know. Sorry: that it must harm itself.
Grieving for the blood shed inward. For why must a body be toxic? In
that question the endeavour: How is the human body made toxic?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>A record of treatment turns the ongoing chronicity of healing into a
past cure, a fait accompli. The slew of blood tests fixes a fictionally
static count of my body in time where a living organism is always
shifting and responding to worldly cycles</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I have not spontaneously ceased this mode of self-defence. I have not
entered a new realm of embodiment by changing locales and breathing new
air. My existence is essentially continuous. I may not know where I’ll
end up, or even where I’m going, but for the time being I sense that I’m
doing what I can to live a life of truth, harmony. Not pushing
needlessly in a direction that won’t have me, but feeling in the dark
for those secure handholds, where a latch awaits my touch. I do not mean
that the path must be easy—rather, that it must carry that distinct
feeling-tone of rightness.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>All I really know is that I wake up each day, thankful for the gift that
is life. I am assailed by doubt and uncertainties. What is there to
ensure that the world has meaning? I choose to believe the order has its
own reason, which I may never grasp. The human answers do not satisfy
me, even when those lives ordered by such stories appeal greatly.. The
only certainty is the is-ness of flesh. Through this is, the world is
sensed in turn. Sensation is divine nature, the great teacher. Confusion
is an aspect of the flesh, when the grandeur of sensing relations
overwhelms the conscious. The flesh itself knows no limits, and may
perceive the oneness of is-ness when left to sense without interference
from my mind.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This is why it pains me to ingest pharmacology’s product. It stretches
and expands the flesh according to logics I do not comprehend. It
activates my body as if it were separate from the mind—leaving me to
make sense of the flesh’s entangled nature all on my own. I am furious
at the lack of guidance afforded me. None explain their reasoning:
Recommendations come as blanket prescriptions, as band-aids. Is no one
looking causation, for cure? Am I?</p>

<p>“The sellers of blood during the Great Financial Crisis who could not
afford breakfast had to ward off fainting episodes once their bodies
were down a pint. They knew well that cash gained through the
commodification of blood can represent a loss for the body. From the
outset, there were both volunteer and paid blood donors. […] In
New York, family and friends of patients were encouraged to donate,
and individuals could earn $35 to $50 per donation. Given average
annual income of around $1,200, the New York Times (February 11,
1923) labeled donating blood the “1,001st Way to Make a Living;” the
donation price attracted people whose benefit from donating, from
altruism and compensation, exceeded their costs (time, discomfort, and
health risks)” (Slonim et al.)</p>

<p>“a liminal temporality, a casting out of time; rather than a stable,
steady progression through the stages of life, time is arrested,
stopped. Paradoxically, even as the very notion of ‘prognosis’ sets up
the future as known and knowable, futurity itself becomes tenuous,
precarious. But this very precariousness can […] become an impetus
for erotic investment in the present, in one’s diagnosed body.”</p>

</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>may gradually be increased up to an infusion rate of 12 mg/kg/min.”</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Let’s pause for some quick math. I weigh approximately 60 kilograms.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>60kg x 2g = 120g or 120’000mg.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Maximum rate of infusion: 12mg/kg/minute</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>12mg x 60kg = 720mg per minute</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>x 60 minutes = 43200mg per hour</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>120’000mg total divided by 43’200mg/hour = 2.77 hours</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>At the maximum rate of infusion, the treatment takes just under 3 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Now the minimum: 0.5mg/kg/minute</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>0.5mg x 60kg = 30 mg per minute</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>x 60 minutes = 1800 mg per hour</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>120’000mg total divided by 1800mg/hour = 66.666… hours</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Or, roughly 67 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>So, IVIG may take me between 3 and 67 hours to receive, per dose.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The reality is somewhere in between, since the rate fluctuates</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>In my experience, infusion took somewhere between 4-8 hours,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>without taking into account the logistical considerations</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>of other appointments, tests, and the fact of getting to the hospital.</p>

Beneath the
cacophony of pressure pulsing in my skull I hear words, fragments of
thought, worries and concerns: suicide; hunger; poverty; last resorts.
Transfusion sends me spiralling through the night sky above Nepal.
Alive, dancing a transient prayer in trance before a kneeling idol.
Venus burns above. Lust seethes and bares its teeth, leaving fire trails
of crimson until control is relinquished willingly. Then each bite tears
away a part for itself, hungry ravenous flesh but not yours alone. We
need variety at this table if we are to dine joyfully. Dust flies with
step of the dancer’s bare feet. Communion intensifies and each
participants feels the Arrival of death and love. Spiralling, to make
known that this body belongs to them. Please, they ask, allow me to
gouge out your eyes, to enact the lessons of pain. Gouging must occur
without anaesthetic of amphetamines of the kinds you give your soldiers.
I’ll keep you isolated in a room with only the minimum necessary
sustenance, have you reach the ground-state of sobriety. Don’t worry,
you’ll survive. I haven’t decided whether to use a fork or a spoon,
which would you prefer? Open your eyes, the nurse tells me, the
treatment is over for today. Tell me you miss me. Tell me how our
distance is hurting you. Tell me how your skin longs for mine. Tell me
how your eyes hunt for mine. Tell me I’m enough of a woman for you. Tell
me my anger is okay. Tell me you understand. Tell me my fear you love me
less is unfounded. Stop telling me about other people, you’re the only
one that matters. Tell me your heart hurts too. Show me, rip out your
sternum and tear apart your thorax and show me. Burning in my chest, our
distance subsides to hollowness when the fire dwindles. I wish I could
scream and wail and break my mirror and immolate my bones if only to
make the feeling dissipate if only to make you go away if only if only
if only it could turn to warm sadness I try to follow to its source that
turns to rage again. Frustration. Would that I could rip out my valvular
pump and hold it up to my cornea, if looking is truly the most effective
way to Know. Broad daylight, sun pierces through the canopy of broadleaf
deciduous life. A harsh metal scrape and the tearing of wood. Push,
pull, push, pull. A human-powered deforestation, saw in hand.
Mechanically we chant to keep the cadence, but I do not hear my own
voice. The tree interpellates me. What are we doing? Why take by
metallic force instead of asking for help? Don’t we know that our
larghissimo elders, the birches, the cedars, the maples, are ready to
fall on their own if we speak the right words? But I do not heed this
train of thought. The saw shakes in my grip and the tree is finally
felled. Would that I could freeze time and devote endless life to
understanding pain’s anatomy. This pain is not my longing for you,
though my longing is there subsumed. This pain is bigger than I am, and
narrow as a platinum razor’s edge. A pickaxe in hand. Heavy beneath an
empty stomach I dig at the grave I will inhabit soon enough. I do not
know when the end arrives. I ask myself whether my grandfather was right
to fear death. At least I will get to stop digging. Nearby, a young man,
younger than me, grey with fatigue, falls. I await the inevitable order:
Oi! Heb das auf, stapel es mit den anderen. I do not complain, merely
comply, do not meet the soldier’s eyes. They lead nowhere I wish to go.
Hier la transfusion m’emmena à Kathmandou, il y a 12 générations.
L’ancêtre sanguin se fit connaître. Je danse en prière devant une
croupissante idole. Vénus brûle au-dessus de moi, et je danse. Un cercle
fiévreux se forme au rythme de mon corps. La poussière virevolte à
chaque pas que prennent mes agiles pieds nus. La communion s’intensifie,
et tous nous ressentons l’Arrivée d’une déesse de l’amour et de la mort.
Je tourbillonne, je dois être à sa hauteur, lui faire savoir que mon
corps est sien, qu’elle n’a qu’à me prendre dans ses bras. These words
are neither me nor not me, not any more or less than the ten thousand
souls that inhabit me. The words: the plasma of thousands within my
veins. Unknowable, yet pained. It is a matter of soul. Too much, too
many. Pressure builds. Only so much can be processed at once. Clogged up
with so many essences. The first 16 hours are the most revelatory. I
know during that period just how alive the plasma remains, dripping from
the flask. My blood is aflame, I run a fever. The first time I stood up,
I thought perhaps a lifetime had gone. Every step riddled with latency,
raising a thermometer takes eons. My vision is blurry, noisy. Each
twitch of a muscle clatters. Standing is akin to shattering a mountain.
I find myself praying. First to Abraham’s God. Then Michaël, Raphaël.
Then my grandparents. Then I beseech those souls directly coursing in my
veins. I address them, plead for respite. Despite being of the blood,
they remember little of the pain of flesh. So it was that my body
recognized them, and did all in its power to remember suffering on their
behalf. The following night I dream long, beautiful dreams full of
longing. For place, for company, for shared meals. We argue
warmheartedly over what to get at the store. I float through the
storeroom. It was dark except for the flood of street-lamps through
makeshift curtains and we both scream ecstasy. Rolling over once the
high leaves my muscles, touch reverts to terror. How many times did I
push them away when I wished to hold us close? The weight of their body
felt crushing upon arms chest gut—any pressure brought a flood of fear.
What if arteries pop veins rip flow ceases? My lover’s head resting upon
my chest brings it all back, the irrational bleeding mind, assailed by
bodily doubt, harrowing anxieties.</p>
<p>Memories of dark purple bulbs, protrusions and all any of us know of
them is bleeding. On a long bus ride, a friendship is forged in
philosophy, a bond of lovers. Ecstasy again awakens me and I find the
migraine mostly gone. So IVIG induced an experience of the sublime. It
might be an entheogen. One body is no proper container for thousands.</p>

<p>It’s my first winter near my grandfather’s grave,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>on occupied territory first named Gespe’gewa’gi,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>seventh district of Mi’gma’gi,</p>

<p>the ancestral and unceeded territory of the Mi’gmaq,</p>

<p>Here, I’ve learned that the wind is a fickle dance partner.</p>

<p>A reception clerk notifies the nurse of my arrival.</p>

<p>Today is March 5th, 2021, and I am still healing.</p>

<p>I await results, self-reparation.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>What does the blood have to say, today?</p>

<p>I am repentant in the face of medicine,</p>
</div>

<p>I’ve come back after voluntary cessation of treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I considered the immediate alternatives</p>

<p>and found the pharmakon I know will at least mitigate symptoms,</p>

<p>Postered on the wall there’s a PSA about STI tests,</p>

<p>a showcase of lovers in ecstatic touch.</p>

<p>I pull my gaze away from the illustrated longing</p>

<p>He’s cheerful, deftly handles the needle.</p>

<p>We talk about the weather as he draws blood.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>This winter, so he says, “has been exceptional, truly.</p>

<p>Exceptionally warm, and brief, and bereft of snow.</p>

<p>Trust me, this is nothing.”</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Before the time of remote friendships, in a limbo reserved for the sick,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>I’m comforted by broken bread shared with others</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Each chronically healing body differs in its minutiae,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>yet sickness breeds a hearth around which to gather and keep warm.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I reach out towards the fire, grateful for company that is not charity.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Grateful for those whose “I’m sorry” is not pity.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>There is no pretence, no brave faces.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>No imperative to cater to the comfort</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>of those who believe they are forever healthy.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I wager that for the sick, those who know that healing is cyclical,</p>

<p>a pandemic’s disruption of time may have felt familiar.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>This pandemic has shown me that</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>discussions of illness are no longer concerned with</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the need to convince or remind the healthy that their certainty,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the self-assured confidence of perpetual health, is illusory.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The news media has done a thorough job of</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>instilling fear, breeding anxiety, and perpetuating</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the poisonous narrative that is the hero’s journey.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>From healthy,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>to sick, soon to be healthy again,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>disease must be overcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Illness must be overcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>So goes the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The calendar lies in tatters at my feet,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>torn pages unstitched as despair and hope</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>enmesh in a spiral dance, a whirlwind</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>shreds my abdomen while delirium burns around me,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>fear succeeds joy and, impatient to get a move on,</p>

<p>I dream of spring.</p>

<p>How long is a year, then?</p>

<p>Amidst a turmoil of organs, unsettled feuds remain.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Needled for a thousand blood draws,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>I’ve come to reject the fiction of illness.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The global immune response to crisis</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>throws into sharp relief that healing is a learned skill.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>There is no plotted course, no long-term plans,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>but illness is not the only story,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and I devise strategies for a sick life.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I remind myself that healing goes on in illness,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>that there is no miraculous cure-all.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Inner awareness, rest, and time off</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>are necessary tools for survival.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am responsible for my own touch-starved self</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and those few with whom I conspire.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I strive to tune into the resonance</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>by which I may make my way my own.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It begins when I listen to the flesh.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Then, breathe with the world and find myself</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>at home within the web of ongoing creation.</p>

<p>Stand still by the estuary</p>

<p>as it pours into the St-Lawrence.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Ice shatters, sends waves up my spine,</p>

<p>and I know that the invisible flows</p>

<p>beneath the rustle of snow</p>

<p>are the same movements felt in my veins</p>

<p>Warmed by the sun under the vertiginous turquoise sky,</p>

<p>another day, another night.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>COVID-19 will “end.” The news cycles and feeds will move on.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>What then? Will the transience of the body itself</p>
</div>

<p>have gained any respect?</p>

<p>Spring turns to summer</p>
</div>

<p>solar rays are talismanic but no protection</p>

<p>against the biting flies.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>It is July 2021.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Deep in the forests of the Bas-Saint-Laurent,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>stiff limbs shed fatigue as they awaken to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Months go by without a blood test.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Hands learn to craft metal and till the dirt.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I spend a week reworking a tin crucifix</p>

<p>into a solar necklace.</p>

<p>with a soft gold sheen.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I give it to my grandmother,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the first piece of jewelry I ever made.</p>

<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Black flies are unavoidable but plantain leaf</p>
</div>
<p>makes an effective poultice.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I learn to walk, tread through the fields</p>
</div>
<p>of foxtail and couch-grass,</p>
<p>attuned to the pollinators whose hum guides my step.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Healing is of the dirt and water, my breath, my bones.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Healing is the love I hold for my body’s proteins.</p>
</div>
<p>Its ligatures, its fats, sugars, spinal liquidity,</p>
<p>and all the microbes with whom I share these cells.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Healing is that peculiar sensation in the optic nerve</p>
</div>
<p>confronted with sublimity,</p>
<p>an old growth forest or an open sky.</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The muscular jouissance of a footstep.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sickness is in the chemical agonists at work on my spine’s marrow.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sickness is the rigidity of my fascia.</p>
</div>
<p>I have so much to learn of healing from the trees,</p>
<p>the birds, the frogs.</p>
<p>The creak of limbs 50 feet above me,</p>
<p>the withering bark, the barren branches.</p>
<div class="hanging">

<p>Autumn, the black tar spot on fallen maple leaves,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>the first scent of snow. The murder croaks at dawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The black birds are telling me to pray, to notice the decay.</p>

</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Battered by winter, it is unclear</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>whether fatigue is physical or existential.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Or it is both.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am an aquifer, from which Thomas’ needle</p>

<p>Into the vial my blood flows,</p>

<p>examined for deficiency to track my risk of bleeding.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>But sickness extends beyond the blood</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>it will not be contained by any such essentializing.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am tackling the problem of healing in the long term.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Sickness, lived not as something to cure,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>escape, climb out of, but as a maze</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>from which there is no exit, no future.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Healing is a labyrinth: it is the snake eating its tail.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Healing is acknowledging that Akeso</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>is too the daughter of Asclepius.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Treating such complexities with words,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>in an attempt to cure pathology</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>according to numbers on a chart,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>all this is too abstract.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Healing is anything but theory.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Without the imperative to strive</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>for a mythical life free from illness,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>a sick existence breeds wondrous possibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am armed with fresh clay through which I mold my body;</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>reams of blank paper upon which to compose symphonies.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The possibilities are not so remote. I choose to live</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>now the universal flourishing of an eternal recurring eden.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am not in a circle of hell,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>but a quiet place, a simple place.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Not the void, but somewhere to gather</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and sing songs.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Thomas withdraws the needle,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>affixes a small bandage to the leaky prick,</p>

<p>secures it with plastic medical tape.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I will wash off the gummy residue for three days.</p>

<p>I thank him and say, “see you next week.”</p>

<p>Back outside, the blizzard has thickened.</p>

<p>Across the hospital parking lot,</p>

<p>I can’t see the water in the distance.</p>

<p>I glean the outline of an oversized,</p>

<p>white-painted wooden cross planted at the cliff’s edge.</p>

<p>On a clear day the visibility stretches for miles,</p>

<p>down the same path I followed up,</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>arm cradled to staunch the pinpoint wound,</p>

<p>curious whether today it will leave a bruise.</p>
</div>

<div class="hanging">
<p>I do not refuse sickness,</p>

<p>I do not refuse the ongoing collapse</p>

<p>that which I cannot control,</p>

<p>The answers come only with time, unbidden, like old friends.</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>No right, no wrong. I am still healing.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I still take pills and attempt to make sense</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>of this body’s enigma.</p>

<p>“We’re all gonna die! We’re all gonna die!</p>
<p>Quick, take cover, get away from the acid rain.”</p>
<p>In a military issue hammock nearby, khaki, green,</p>
<p>strung between a clothesline post and a young cedar,</p>
<p>I’m taking in the sunshine of high-spring</p>
<p>in the valley below Mont-Comi in the Bas-Saint-Laurent.</p>
<p>The horrendously joyous cackle nearby</p>
<p>the ode to impending doom</p>
<p>is the sound of children at play</p>
<p>on an oldschool trampoline, no safety netting.</p>
<p>They’re huddled, yes,</p>
<p>under blankets, unzipped sleeping bags,</p>
<p>a fortress of their own design.</p>
<p>Limbs mustn’t tresspass the protection of the game.</p>
<p>They all have enough to drink.</p>
<p>It arrives in the home via tap and consigned plastic jugs.</p>
<p>From the pipes, it sits in glass pitchers on the bar</p>

<p>with no concern for heavy metals or pathogens.</p>

<p>Most mornings, they breakfast.</p>
<p>Eating any of the following, depending on their mood:</p>
<p>supermarket multigrain toast with butter,</p>
<p>white sugar cereal with milk,</p>
<p>cow’s yogurt, fruit, or ramen noodles.</p>
<p>The eldest sometimes fasts, by choice.</p>

<p>Dreamt of a matriarch’s confession:</p>
<p>“I do not understand the world,</p>

<p>Sat on a couch that each night serves as a bed,</p>
<p>eyes alternating between</p>
<p>Love In The Time Of Cholera</p>
<p>and the Gospel of Luke.</p>
<p>Thomas sits next to me, reading l’Agent Jean,</p>
<p>a Quebecois comic book for kids,</p>
<p>depicting the adventures of</p>
<p>a supergenius secret agent</p>
<p>anthropomorphic moose</p>
<p>named Jean, and</p>
<p>his wacky shenanigans</p>
<p>saving the world from absurd threats.</p>
<p>Thomas and his brother Isaac</p>
<p>are armed with waffled-cones full of</p>
<p>homemade food-processor icecream.</p>
<p>They love l’Agent Jean.</p>
<p>The drawings are high-impact colour fever dreams,</p>

<p>Thomas comes to see me later at the dining table,</p>

<p>Henry is a nerdy lizard who’s won 4 nobel prizes</p>
<p>but “ne parle pas anglais.”</p>
<p>It’s an archetypal story; Bond, made sillier.</p>
<p>Easy to believe this is the most fun reading around.</p>
<p>The kids have a book compiling all the characters and their metadata.</p>
<p>“But it’s wrong! Colère first appeared in Tome 1, not Tome 4!”</p>
<p>Whiplash as we transition to playing tic-tac-toe.</p>
<p>Isaac demonstrates expertise in rigging the board,</p>
<p>but, I ask them, how inane is an unloseable game?</p>
<p><em>May 18th</em></p>
<p>It’s evening, I am alone here.</p>
<p>No one else except, I realize, the cat.</p>
<p>I went out to the firepit and burned a letter,</p>
<p>watched the embers go out.</p>
<p>Back in the house,</p>
<p>I sit next to the cat</p>
<p>get to scratching, petting.</p>
<p>A low purr, and she moves into a better position for her.</p>
<p>Pads softly around me, I turn at the spine to follow.</p>
<p>Skull, neck, thorax, haunches. My hand runs over smoky fur.</p>
<p>She bends in, contorting to reach her sex with tongue</p>
<p>and licks herself avidly. Small body beats and</p>
<p>shudders until she suddenly stops, looks around.</p>
<p>The moment has passed.</p>
<p>I was merely some help, a privileged witness.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">

<p><em>June 15th</em></p>
<p>Those movements of rivers overflowing</p>
<p>are the same as veins leaking.</p>
<p>A whisper in the poplar trees</p>
<p>I was tasked with trimming.</p>
<p>Saw off live branches, peel off the bark.</p>
<p>Notice inside the branch the artery bleeds red,</p>
<p>sickly sweet within white wood.</p>
<p>There will be no cure, I am healing myself.</p>
<p>I shed all regrets for every day in this life</p>
<p>that the sun rises and sets.</p>
<p>Nights spent in a tent to wake up</p>
<p>under the fury of Mars.</p>
<p>Ursa Major illuminating the barley field.</p>
<p>A harvest moon so bright I cast a shadow,</p>
<p>treading carefully so as not to trip,</p>
<p>seeking a key, the key that was stolen at birth,</p>
<p>So easy to get lost.</p>

<p>Enough food, a safe shelter, people with whom to share my life.</p>
<p>Asceticism is about claiming the power to refuse.</p>
<p>The etymology has been traced to the 17th century,</p>
<p>from Medieval Latin asceticus,</p>
<p>from Ancient Greek ἀσκητικός (askētikós),</p>
<p>from ἀσκητής (askētḗs, “monk, hermit”),</p>
<p>from ἀσκέω (askéō, “I exercise”).</p>
<p>There’s the french word acèse, asceticism, abstention.</p>
<p>The god/dess of asceticism is Akeso,</p>
<p>daughter of Asclepius, the Physician of the gods.</p>
<p>Akeso is honest. Akeso is an alchemist. Akeso is temperance.</p>
<p>Sometimes harsh, sometimes gentle.</p>
<p>Always attuned to the needs of healing.</p>
<p>They do not heal so much as guide</p>
<p>the sick towards convalescence,</p>
<p>regeneration, re(in)storing their own capacity for recuperation.</p>
<p>From Ancient Greek Ἀκεσώ (Akesṓ).</p>
<p>In Portuguese, Galician, Italian, related to:</p>
<p>(transitive) to light, set alight, ignite, kindle</p>
<p>(transitive) to turn on (a device)</p>
<p>(transitive, figuratively) to fire up</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<p>So I read here a relation to training, practice,</p>
<p>an ongoing effort to deepen devotion and commitment.</p>
<p>The ascetic is traditionally a lone practitioner,</p>
<p>more closely related with the hermit</p>
<p>than the communal monastic (french: <em>cénobite</em>).</p>
<p>The ascetic need not preach, or attempt to convert others to their
cause.</p>
<p>The definitions of asceticism I’ve found</p>
<p>commonly point towards either a moral practice or an artistic practice.</p>
<p>I am more aligned with ascesis as an art.</p>
<p>This is not a moral undertaking.</p>
<p>Rather, it is a response to global poisoning,</p>
<p>and a way to claim personal well-being,</p>
<p>individual action, pure negation.</p>
<p>Making space for something else.</p>
<p>My nascent asceticism acknowledges</p>
<p>that “the world” will not be saved,</p>
<p>that no saviour exists outside myself,</p>
<p>that supply chain collapse is ongoing,</p>
<p>that consumption wreaks havoc upon personal autonomy.</p>
<p>The practice involves learning to discern need from want,</p>
<p>sensing when want is an external imposition,</p>
<p>and refusing all that does not serve Life.</p>
<p>If, as Mircea Eliade suggests,</p>
<p>the sacred is defined spatially,</p>
<p>comes into being through delimitation,</p>
<p>exists as the exceptional place (Foucault’s heterotopia),</p>
<p>then the Sacred is a standpoint to adopt,</p>
<p>a place from which to survey the wasteland,</p>
<p>and a devotee’s habit to don as sheer refusal.</p>
<p>Refusal to engage with the profane,</p>
<p>refusal to inhabit the culture that continues to wreak havoc,</p>
<p>refusal to consume its commodities.</p>
<p>Rare is tuberculosis, yet how many still die consumptive?</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<p>Living a sacred life necessarily means acknowledging divinity;</p>
<p>not as god-almighty-on-high, merely as that-which-is.</p>
<p>For now, suffice to say divinity exists as an experience.</p>
<p>The metaphors for its facade are numerous.</p>
<p>Keep the practice joyful,</p>
<p>make room for physical pleasure,</p>
<p>sensuousness, salaciousness.</p>
<p>Refuse to imbibe the pornographer’s easy meals.</p>
<p>Refuse the ready-to-think.</p>
<p>Refuse the pre-fabricated desires.</p>
<p>Abstain from cherry-picked realms of possibility.</p>
<p>Asceticism is the study of Life.</p>
<p>It is a syncretic approach,</p>
<p>meaning it takes what works from anywhere,</p>
<p>and refuses nonsense from anywhere.</p>
<p>In practice, the ascetic hones their sense of discernment,</p>
<p>their sensitivity, their bullshit detectors.</p>
<p>This is, ultimately, a game to play.</p>
<p>Inward, the search begins.</p>
<p>The search for that which is not spoken of.</p>
<p>But for whom is initiation an option in the first place?</p>
<p>And where, now, is the line between the speakable and the unspeakable?</p>
<p>Any wisdom gained will only be the wisdom of a dying civilization.</p>
<p>Pray to the old and new gods.</p>
<p>Worship in whatever way makes sense to you,</p>
<p>and do not expect your rites to make sense to your children.</p>
<p>Rites and ceremonies are potent tools.</p>
<p>From such movements arises gnosis,</p>
<p>deeply affecting practitioners and,</p>
<p>if devotion is sincere, changing the core of orientation to Life.</p>
<p>Ritual holds the power to transform one’s own world,</p>
<p>and learn about the shared realities.</p>
<p>Ceremony alone, however, is hollow.</p>
<p>It is needfully directed by conscious control of the individual,</p>
<p>otherwise known as will, intent, attention, focus.</p>
<p>Without focus, ceremony is void of potency.</p>
<p>Some things are certain:</p>
<p>honestly performing established scripts leads to results,</p>
<p>and the results can profoundly alter experience.</p>
<p>Magic is a metaphor,</p>
<p>useful for making individual sense of patterns</p>
<p>that are too big to hold in the conscious mind.</p>
<p>It is an orientation device for mentation,</p>
<p>and useful for someone</p>
<p>who feels called to power for its own sake.</p>
<p>But why bother?</p>
<p>An ascetic approach acknowledges the ongoing process.</p>
<p>I inhabit the world of my own making,</p>
<p>while factors which I do not consciously hold in mind</p>
<p>continue to affect actions/decisions/options.</p>
<p>The theory is meaningless on its own.</p>
<p>Study for its own sake is navel-gazing.</p>
<p>Overloading intellect with big words</p>
<p>in the hope of spontaneously <em>getting it</em> leads nowhere,</p>
<p>not even disillusion. It is necessary to experiment, and to fail.</p>
<p>Whatever feels intuitive is a clue.</p>
<p>Whatever poses challenges but keeps interest is another.</p>
<p>There is much less to learn from other people than expected.</p>
<p>Auto-didactics are a key factor.</p>
<p>Desire is another. I want learning.</p>
<p>I want transformation.</p>

<p>Si ce n’est un poème</p>
<p>du moins ce sera une histoire.</p>
<p>C’est un jour de retour et d’arrivée</p>
<p>Si cette journée m’apporte mélancolie</p>
<p>accompagnant les voeux</p>
<p>cela doit être signe que l’hiver tire à sa fin</p>
<p>Dernier quart de lune pour un début, retour</p>
<p>autour de ce soleil salvateur</p>
<p>Absurd hilarious horror we know</p>
<p>it’s about not knowing until it’s</p>
<p>already happened</p>
<p>So I laugh</p>
<p>at my silly sense of self-aggrandizement</p>
<p>The crux of my problems lately is that I feel useless</p>
<p>So, find a way to be useful</p>
<p>Consciente, je rêve</p>
<p>d’affectivité expérimentale</p>
<p>d’épaves, où jouir d’entregens</p>
<p>d’énergie, de dynamisme chaotique</p>
<p>Je répercute toutes les entraves</p>
<p>qui me traversent</p>
<p>et le défi, c’est</p>
<p>simplement de remarquer</p>
<p>les clôtures</p>
<p>Attention, ce qui fut commun fut saisit</p>
<p>Feu, y mettre feu</p>
<p>Tout braquer, détruire ce qui m’étrangle</p>
<p>ce qui me noue, la gorge</p>
<p>sèche, asséché, vide</p>
<p>de sens à boire sans cesse</p>
<p>ces eaux ce chlore</p>
<p>pour s’empoisonner</p>
<p>consciemment</p>
<p>je dois guérir.</p>
<p>C’est qu’à 20 ans</p>
<p>je me suis réveillée</p>
<p>J’ai réalisé que je suis</p>
<p>vivante, encore vivante.</p>
<p>C’est qu’à 25 ans j’ai découvert</p>
<p>mon ignorance, j’ai apprivoisé mon deuil.</p>
<p>C’est qu’aujourd’hui, la fatigue me lorgne</p>
<p>et je n’y peux toujours rien.</p>
<p>Alors j’imagine le printemps</p>
<p>J’imagine un monde créé collectivement</p>
<p>qui n’a rien à foutre</p>
<p>de la droite et la gauche</p>
<p>J’imagine des sentiers en terre battue</p>
<p>sur lesquels ne roulent aucune ferraille</p>
<p>J’imagine une vie parsemée de déplacements</p>
<p>s’effectuant uniquement à pied.</p>
<p>J’imagine la santé pour toustes</p>
<p>J’imagine une humanité</p>
<p>fortement réduite</p>
<p>Réapprivoisant cette terre</p>
<p>la seule que nous ayons</p>
<p>J’imagine la fin du cauchemar industriel.</p>
<p>Je m’imagine que la mort est nécessaire à la naissance</p>
<p>tout comme la pause est nécessaire à l’acte.</p>
<p>J’imagine volontiers un éden devenu désert</p>
<p>avec les fausses promesses de ces textes</p>
<p>millénaires enfin mises à nues.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<p>Je rêve de défaire tout</p>
<p>ce que mes ancêtres blancs,</p>
<p>gaspésiens depuis 300 ans,</p>
<p>ont commis dans l’ignorance et la hâte</p>
<p>Je rêve de faire des choix</p>
<p>qui feront l’honneur et non la honte</p>
<p>de mes descendantes.</p>
<p>Si c’est vrai qu’il faut penser</p>
<p>pour sept générations</p>
<p>Je me demande bien ce qu’imaginaient</p>
<p>les colons dont je naquis</p>
<p>celleux qui avaient</p>
<p>30 arpents et plus;</p>
<p>considéraient-iels</p>
<p>le vol, le meurtre?</p>
<p>Et moi, en ai-je vraiment conscience?</p>
<p>J’imagine ce qui viendra après</p>
<p>Puis je me souviens qu’une définition possible de l’anarchie, c’est:</p>
<p>“sans début ni fin”</p>
<p>Alors il n’y aurait que maintenant</p>
<p>Ici; où l’éternel pénètre le temporel</p>
<p>Parmi nous.</p>
<p>Et si la mélancolie m’accompagne</p>
<p>en ce jour, ce n’est pas à défaut</p>
<p>de rêves, de joie. Si la tristesse</p>
<p>est présente, c’est qu’elle l’est</p>
<p>toujours, vivant en temps de deuil.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<p>Alors j’imagine le soleil</p>
<p>et les amix</p>
<p>et les abeilles</p>
<p>et je me dis que chaque moment</p>
<p>vécu pleinement</p>
<p>est en soi une forme révolutionnaire</p>
<p>Et chaque rêve raconté</p>
<p>me rapproche du monde désiré</p>
<p>de l’autre côté de cette folie collective</p>
<p>que les dormeurs ne remarquent même pas.</p>

<p>As all rites of passage, I had to shed any notions of knowing</p>
<p>who, where, when, and why I was.</p>
<p>As all thresholds, the other side was invisible from the entryway,</p>
<p>unknown and unknowable to me.</p>
<p>The morass of digital communication weighs heavy,</p>
<p>and isolation is not aided by over-engagement.</p>
<p>I discern conflicting impulses within myself,</p>
<p>doubts and trust coexisting, and feel on the verge of birth.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is because I will soon turn 26.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is because the past year has held</p>
<p>inexpressable lows and vertiginous highs.</p>
<p>I had ceased all medical supervision,</p>
<p>believing then, as i do now,</p>
<p>that I am better equipped to heal myself</p>
<p>than any other doctor.</p>
<p>Hubris was my downfall,</p>
<p>as were a series of mistakes</p>
<p>stemming from hurried action</p>
<p>chasmic gaps in my own knowledge.</p>
<p>The refusal to take my pills had the effect</p>
<p>of revealing symptoms that had lain dormant for a decade.</p>
<p>I precipitated this, stepping wildly through a thick fog</p>
<p>on the frozen banks of the river sainte-anne, praying,</p>
<p>hoping that health would occur spontaneously.</p>
<p>Now, where I then had only fear and longing,</p>
<p>I now have words to describe that particular crisis of healing.</p>
<p>An inapt diet was the catalyst for toxemia</p>
<p>and the emergence of dysbiosis,</p>
<p>or, the sheer destruction of the microbiome</p>
<p>whch protects and regulates my organism.</p>
<p>I was vulnerable, my gut homeostasis was fragile</p>
<p>from 20 years of regular subjection to antiobiotics and other poisons.</p>
<p>My years of binge drinking taught me,</p>
<p>eventually, the value of abstention,</p>
<p>but not how to go about caring for a body</p>
<p>taxed heavily by the drugs of modern life.</p>
<p>From the moment I started drinking, I abused my liver.</p>
<p>From the day I got on Revolade, I imposed undue stress on my liver.</p>
<p>It’s where I am now holding tension still.</p>
<p>Right where the diaphragm meets the top of the liver.</p>
<p>So a year ago, I was alone with my symptoms.</p>
<p>I decided then the drug I’d been prescribed</p>
<p>and taking since 2015 would still be of use.</p>
<p>A new doctor took the place of the old.</p>
<p>This specialist I’ve never met,</p>
<p>and whose voice I only ever hear in 10 minute increments,</p>
<p>mobilized the machine of pharmacy.</p>
<p>The wait for renewal, mere weeks, was too long.</p>
<p>Blood tests indicated a need for emergency treatments.</p>
<p>So, under the needle and the crystalline bag I went.</p>
<p>I partook in the logistical ritual of medicine once more.</p>
<p>The top floor of the CISSS de la Haute-Gaspésie</p>
<p>welcomes me onto the colonized land of Gespe’gewa’gi.</p>
<p>Sterile, this new waiting room.</p>
<p>I wait patiently until Marie calls me to her,</p>
<p>and I walk to treatment, my bright blue-slippered feet</p>
<p>follow her to the hall of recliners.</p>

<p>has joined us locally, mixed our waters.</p>
<p>Birth circumstances on this artificially fractured continent</p>
<p>place us on either side of a free trade agreement.</p>
<p>My doctor’s signature on the prescription</p>
<p>reaches across time and binds me to the donors</p>
<p>whose act expedites my temporary cure.</p>
<p>The thousands become my bio-spiritual ancestors</p>
<p>and theirs are lessons to heed in the blood.</p>
<p>How am I to understand transfusion?</p>
<p>It’s a slow remembering, a reconstruction.</p>
<p>Drop by crystal drop the infusion is vetted, approved, absorbed.</p>
<p>The memory is wholly mine, but the blood is legion.</p>
<p>I won’t pretend to understand all the mechanisms at work</p>
<p>pharmacokinetics and the like.</p>
<p>Medicine has its explanations for what I’ve undergone;</p>
<p>This pamphlet is my own interpretation.</p>
<p>I’m struggling to make sense</p>
<p>of what those 72 hours post-IVIG mark in my life.</p>
<p>I had just turned 25. I was looking for answers,</p>
<p>having not yet learned that, at best,</p>
<p>I can merely refine my questions.</p>
<p>At the time, it felt like something profound ought to come from agony.</p>
<p>But perhaps it is the banality, the ultimate meaninglessness of
side-effects</p>
<p>that is revealed here. What right have I to claim some importance,</p>
<p>to ascribe meaning to the everyday? Remember this: we all suffer.</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The meaning is not in the suffering itself.</p>
</div>
<p>How could I possibly justify painkillers if it were?</p>
<p>Is sense experience inherently meaningful?</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Is anaesthesia, then, a poison, chilling the soul</p>
</div>
<p>as well as the body?</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Ought I have let the migraine run its course</p>
</div>
<p>without those little tylenol pills?</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>What experience or insight did I deprive myself of</p>
</div>
<p>by choosing to minimize pain?</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Is this line of questioning merely playing</p>
</div>
<p>into a masochist hero’s narrative?</p>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Or a fantasy of the tortured mystic?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Another question in progress:</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>How do the pharmaco-kinetics of intravenous blood products</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>affect bio-spiritually intra-acting bodies?</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Simple: I do not know.</p>

<p>In the midst of pandemic,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I shed many of my preconceived notions</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I had long held about my own reality.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I was (and am) giving serious consideration</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>to the aspects of my experience</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>that I could not fit into a materialist framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I dove, alone, ever deeper into myself,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>away from as much of the noise as I could,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and found faith in the existence of divinity on earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I found that even as I critically examine</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the claims of charlatans</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and continue to reject their postural pretences,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>their false certainties, their easy assurances,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>there is an intangible, indefinite, inner resonance</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>to the notion that this human body</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>is a direct conduit for my experience of god.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I know now that healing is a series of definite mechanisms</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>harnessing the body’s innate capacity for adaptation.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>My path is aligned with the middle way, the way of the heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am neither shunning my embodied state,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>nor am I attached to it as a stable, unshifting identity.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Without striving towards any spiritual goal,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I remain aware of the continual tension between edifice and dissolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I practice in order to neither hold on to my biographical history</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>as the sole source of my identity, nor relinquish</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the potential for transformation that inheres</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>to the condition of being alive as a human being.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Jouissance is an aspect of the art of getting lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Creative forgetfulness is part of the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Internal alchemy is the process of consciously rearranging one’s inner
being.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am not enlightened, nor is it true that I know nothing at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am slowly knowing myself, and I know what I’ve learned,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>what I’ve experienced. I know some of what I do not know.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I am not merely an empty vessel for divinity,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>but a collaborator with the universal forces.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Being me is a worthwhile endeavour in and of itself,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and so is noting the patterns that have calcified</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>over the course of my life so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>The river thaws, its flows inexorable.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>I practice lovingkindness for the land itself,</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>the boulders in Rivière-Du-Loup’s Parc Des Chutes, the moss.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>May they be at peace, free from suffering.</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Hollow human words for a stone,</p>

<p>What does the land need?</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>Time, which it has.</p>

<p>Love, presence, acknowledgement.</p>

<p>The dirt is not alone, I am here.</p>

<p>We are here, those of us who are awake</p>

<p>with compassion for the web of life.</p>
</div>
<div style="page-break-before:always;">
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>Hold the bodies close together</p>
</div>
<div class="hanging">
<p>and find they resolve into</p>

<div class="hanging">
<p>dissolution, disillusion. One</p>
