Place Inter WOFF2 files here to host Inter locally.

Recommended filenames:
- Inter-Variable.woff2 (variable or regular)
- Inter-Regular.woff2
- Inter-Bold.woff2

You can download Inter from Google Fonts or https://rsms.me/inter/ and place the files in this folder. Once added, `Head.tsx` will preload `/static/fonts/inter/Inter-Variable.woff2` for better LCP.
