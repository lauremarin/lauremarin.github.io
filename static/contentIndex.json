That doesn’t even seem like that many. I only had to wait about 10 minutes on the 14th floor, the oncology ward in the sky with its giant windows and magnificent view of the St Laurent. Then I had a needle stuck in my arm for all of 30 seconds. Routine. Usually, I get to leave afterwards, but that day I had an appointment 12 floors down, in gastroenterology, where the waiting room is windowless and most people are not in fact facing life-threatening disease. Maybe that’s why we don’t get windows. My appointment was at 10:45. I arrived early, and I waited 150 minutes. I did not see a doctor. ‘Can you come back next week?’ Due to a system error, the MD didn’t get notified of my arrival. So the time had passed. She couldn’t see me today. Next week. Imagine if I already had a real job. Still, now I have a doctor’s note for the day of the climate march, which is appropriately political in and of itself.\nDoubtless, many of the people there, like me, wished they could be marching. We too want to feel a part of that currently-forming mass, the soon-to-be-seething demonstration. As it turns out, the demonstration was rather a celebratory send-off for Gaia than a seething act of revolution. Instead, we are sitting in chairs, waiting patiently for expert examination and diagnosis, hoping our bodily prognosis is better than that of this earth. Bitter irony I have not yet resolved, facing the obstacles to action imposed by a body that begs for societal reform but has only just the energy to survive and remain calm. Perhaps calm is a coping mechanism, because to lose calm is to fall into anger, despair, unsustainable emotions when there is rent to be paid and loved ones to support.\nI tell my eco-capitalist friend that the system has failed and he asks me if I have any Solutions. I do not. ‘Perhaps a project for the future’, he replies. I tell him we can’t all be economic theorists and he tells me of his aspirations for a PhD in economics. I look forward to your dissertation about numbers, friend. Meanwhile, instead of solutions to problems I barely have the energy to face, my projects exist at a human scale. For a cause, I take up the suffering of my self and my loved ones. There is no other way to exist in a world that is ending but community support. Nothing to be done except mutual support, redistribution of wealth, and creation of space for grief and joy. I did not feel like an activist. I am just another person with personal burdens to bear. I do not know what the future holds, only that I will continue to love, and one day I will die. Many other things will happen too, but those seem insignificant to me now.\nI hear within myself: You aren’t doing enough. That voice will always be there, fighting the harsh reality of personal limitations. Maman reminds me that everyone has limits they must face, that we must all contend with ourselves and do what we can within our communities. She’s right. Some New Yorker staff writer said on the radio that one of the great projects for anyone who is alive right now is to try and be as human as possible within dehumanizing systems. She’s right, too. So what now? For now I have a headache and I’ve already had a coffee. For now I keep my loved ones close. For now I don’t buy things I don’t need. For now I get an office job so I don’t have to stand outside in the cold. For now I try to get enough sleep. For now I keep my medical appointments. For now I keep a journal. For now I appreciate the beauty of a rainy day in early October. For now I breathe. For now I send an email to a selection of BCC’d friends who may be feeling some of the things I’m feeling.\nWith care,\nem"},"2019/11/2019-11-11-dune-so-far":{"slug":"2019/11/2019-11-11-dune-so-far","filePath":"2019/11/2019-11-11-dune-so-far.md","title":"Dune So Far","links":[],"tags":["blog-books"],"content":"The following post is full of rambling spoilers for the Dune saga (up to book 3), proceed only if that’s okay. Originally sent out via personal email.\nThis past summer I found the first tome in a community book box and devoured it. I’m now nearly done book 3 and just want to share some thoughts. Frank Herbert’s storytelling weaves together lines of political intrigue, existential questioning, meditations on planetary ecology, and, of course, good old ultraviolence. And let’s not forget casual sexism and exoticism of non-western cultures. You know, all the usual stuff you’d encounter in any 20th century epic written by a white man. The purpose of this current email? Just sharing, not trying to form any coherent critique of what is apparently the best selling sci-fi of all time.\nIn brief: Dune is a sweeping political drama set tens of thousands of years in the future, taking place over many human lifetimes, tracing the tides of power along ever-increasing stakes in an outsized universe-spanning empire. The saga chronicles a civilization which has banned all forms of computers, or “thinking machines”, but has also developed advanced technology and mental and physical abilities. Filled to the brim with anti-heroes, no character is fully known to me as reader in spite of the 3rd person omniscient narration. Arrakis, Dune, is the desert planet from which the series takes its name, and is only home to the Spice Melange: source of long life and prescience. Atreides, Harkonnen, Corrino: Great Feudal Houses vying for political-economic dominance. Bene Gesserit: a sisterhood of witches always on the sidelines of power. The Ultimate goal: total prescience, control over the future, endless knowledge of the depths of the past.\nThere’s a lot going on. So what? What is it about page after page of intrigue at an ever-expanding scale that keeps me turning pages? The answer is prose. Throughout the saga there have regularly been series of words which strike right to the core of my own concerns with life &amp; death—isn’t that what reading (and, tangentially, writing) is all about? So far Herbert has managed to create an entrancing world, the scope of which I’m nowhere near fully grasping, all the while making his characters grapple with some of my favourite Big Questions. For instance: What is the purpose of religion in society? How do we govern? Does power corrupt? Is one’s own body knowable at a cellular level? How do we experience time? How do we remain adaptable in the face of adversity? Part of the appeal is that after all these pages I still have no idea where the story is headed. Through the world building and multitudes of conflicting viewpoints, the development of character motivations and the tension of conversation, the prose drives the story ever onward in a manner that’s anything but straightforward.\nOne of the central themes that resonates with me the most is the author’s fascination with the function of time in human life. The ducal heir turned living deity Paul Atreides aka Muad’dib, the messiah, is at the crux of this. Through drinking a concoction of poisonous spice melange, he gains access to perfect knowledge of the future and is unable to stray from his vision. In essence, he locks his universe into his own prescient knowledge of the future. Everyone’s free will is in fact just going through the motions of a universe always already dictated by Paul’s prescience. From his isolated desert planet, Paul defeats the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and negotiates for a wedding of their houses in exchange for peace and power. The result? A universe-wide hostile religious takeover of the empire in the name of Paul Muad’dib Atreides, newly ascended to the position of Emperor.\nIn Dune Messiah, Paul loses his eyes when exposed to nuclear radiation during combat, and continues to see the people and things around him in all-knowing detail. Muad’dib knows the future, does everything in his power to avoid its terrible (read: genocidal) path, and fails. Let’s take a minute to examine the disability angle here. Herbert is creating an omniscient human deity whose prescience overcomes even physical blindness within a world where the blind are sent into the desert to perish. The myth of Paul Muad’dib is blown out of proportion when he willingly walks into the desert alone (to his death????). Here we have a character whose knowledge of Time is so complete and total that he no longer needs sight to orient himself in the world. Paul chooses to forego prosthetic eyes (but orders that his radiation-blind soldiers be equipped with them). He is described as moving in ways that are characteristically not blind. He looks directly at people, has a sureness of motion, even flies a helicopter across the desert. I’m struggling to figure out how I feel about this use of blindness in narrative. Disability in text is often a narrative crutch that the author throws in to make a shallow point about the character. i.e “the messiah is blind but he SEES”. I suppose that is in fact what’s happening here. A generation later, a blind Prophet appears on Dune, denouncing the mechanisms of power that have been harnessed in the name of Muad’dib. The kicker? This prophet is Paul, not that anyone in the book knows that for sure, except for his equally mystical sister Alia, the Unborn, now Regent of the empire, who has fallen prey to possession by the ghost of their diabolical grandfather whose consciousness resides within her genetic code. And that’s where I’m at right now."},"2019/12/2019-12-31-booklist":{"slug":"2019/12/2019-12-31-booklist","filePath":"2019/12/2019-12-31-booklist.md","title":"2019 booklist","links":[],"tags":["blog-books-booklist"],"content":"First year I kept track of books read in full.

Discord supports text, audio, and video calling for groups.\nI have previously engaged with some of you in the context of the Reading Illness group last summer, and would have these meetings continue some of the work we did there. Together, we asked: What about illness isreal? For whom? We now ask: What senses do we lack that we cannot feel another world all around us? What aren’t we learning from how we see, hear, touch, and otherwise absorb the world? Reality is sick. What may we invent to heal it? Join us if you are interested in talking about how reality feels, so that what we may all learn together.\nThese discussions may be heavy.

I do nothing but breathe and pick up the energetic charge of 2 human bodies amidst home appliances and neighbours hidden away by walls. My breath whispers: How simple, inhale exhale over again the first to last thing we’ll ever do. It’s the repetition that counts, one breath is nothing for the body, we need air uncounted yet we account for a chemical regime, a specialized diet of far more than oxygen which is poison anyway in overdose. The air we share is a floating, transparent pharmacy not-so-carefully calibrated, and precisely weaponized.\nI’m lucky when I discern her specific scent from the others, when my sense of smell isn’t distracted by some noise. If the fridge hums I can’t make her out. Above the stove there’s one of those golden plastic cats whose arm waves metronomically with a little solar cell panel. A plastic Maneki-neko souvenir trinket. A seated cat, a bib around its neck, a bell or two, a bastardized japanese koban coin, a paw raised. Literally a “beckoning cat,” the swinging arm’s tick-tocks are always audible, like a clock that announces no time in particular when I deign to look over but rather speaks only to its own presence on that stove here in so-called montreal. I don’t know whether the cat ever stops beckoning a timeless now. All it seems to accomplish is a reminder that the old stove’s analog time-set is dysfunctional.\nThe iconic beckoning cat appears to have originated in late Edo period feudal japan, and can now be acquired wholesale on Alibaba at the astonishing rate of up to five-hundred-thousand units per month, shipped out of Xiamen, a city in the southeastern China beside the Taiwan Strait. The Maneki-neko in this apartment was manufactured in China, passed quality control and imported to America, so say the embossments and sticker on the bottom, before being purchased and turned into a souvenir in this home. There are 2 screws in the base that let me take it apart so I do, in the hopes that peering into the lucky cat’s innards will reveal something essential about the nature of time itself. What I find instead of a hollow metaphor is another series of plastic and metal components that come together to make up the swinging arm mechanism. Likely harvested anywhere on earth, mined out of deep time’s accretion in the dirt and forged out of globalized myth—the golden cat is storied. The Maneki-neko is a symbol of good fortune, arising out of a story involving a destitute shop, temple, inn; the poor proprietors take in a hungry and neglected cat. After being cared for and loved, the cat ventures out front, sits there and beckons to passers-by, thus shifting the fortunes of the establishment and bringing prosperity. Whose idea was this cultural export? Did they grow up with their own cherished cats either animate or carved? Either way they turned around and sold myth down the river for capital gain because it seemed the logical thing to do. I don’t blame them but that doesn’t stop me from despising the swinging arm sometimes when I’m just breathing but then its tack tick tack tick sticks to my eardrum and I can’t shake off this little cat’s little hand. I mention to Mae that I’m writing about this cat and learn that apparently she bought it years ago in NYC chinatown when roaming the streets as tourists with friends. One of them was leading the group astray and everyone was frustrated but ultimately souvenirs were purchased, packed up in suitcases, brought back to NB and eventually moved to MTL. So the cat is here, from everywhere, signalling no time at all.\nSometimes when I’m lucky I lose my sense of object permanence. Out of willful forgetfulness comes a void full of nothing from which to learn. Things fade in and out of thingness and cease their clutter. For a time I get to forget what surrounds me, some of it, and breathe as if I weren’t aware that the objects that inhabit my day-to-day are fragments displaced from the earth entire."},"2020/05/2020-05-21-navigating-physical-exercise":{"slug":"2020/05/2020-05-21-navigating-physical-exercise","filePath":"2020/05/2020-05-21-navigating-physical-exercise.md","title":"Navigating Physical Exercise","links":[],"tags":["blog-pandemic"],"content":"The bike’s a black and grey chromoly steel single-speed with red handlebars. Good tires decently inflated because the streets of so-called-montréal’s rife with debris glass construction cracks and there are few things worse than getting a flat on the other side of town. Bike lanes are useful but when there’s a crowd I’d rather speed with the fossil fumes. Automobiles with their conditioned air pockets exude pollution that right now I’d rather breathe near instead of other humans. How sad. On the news each day we see how pandemic has slowed industry and the skies are clearing. No one seems to respect social distancing guidelines in this city’s bike lanes, I roll around feet strapped in as I relax my legs and let myself coast. I feel free. Body strapped to metal I am thrilled to have hills and gravity as teammates or adversaries. Any slip-up is mine. If I hurt myself, I chose that possibility. I just remain aware and navigate the obstacles that present themselves. Weighing expectations for what my body can do against reality happens on a rolling basis, always subject to sickness. I have to navigate what is a feasible amount of exertion, which activities are off the table. From the time of my diagnosis certain games have been no-go because of the risks involved in rushing around with a dozen other people focused on a ball. So, I turned to mostly solitary pursuits. To the chronically ill child I was, this seemed like a way to gain control over my health. It’s long been a little too easy to pop my blood vessels. But last year I started dancing regularly. One saturday in November I danced all day in a crowd writhing with a hundred others at mtl’s annual contact jam. 8 months prior, I could hardly walk alone for 15 minutes. There was bliss in sharing gravity’s embrace. If I tried dancing for a full day again tomorrow, recovery may prove difficult. I could probably dance for an hour, but I feel no urge to dance alone. That was a care-free weekend, after which I took 3 full days off the office job I’d gotten to pay bills so that I could begin to recover. I’ve realized my body isn’t fragile, but adaptable so long as I don’t overdo it. Somedays I feel powerless, afraid, off-balance, like my presence cannot but have a negative impact on my world. I know that I can harness my capacity to learn, focus it towards positive change in the world around me, being a community member. What if things just keep getting worse? If there’s no more casual community? What if chance &amp; happenstance are no longer viable ways to meet people? But of course they still are. The web of randomness is woven through all situations. The best I can do right now is focus on strengthening myself and honing my skills. Now I’m not wage-labouring, but I have lost care-free days. Physical wellbeing is at stake as well as mental. My days sometimes feel like a rush from one basic necessity to another. Self care stops being a source of joy when I’m barely keeping my head above water. Now a day mustn’t go by without me checking in with myself. Throat clenched chest weighed down stress induced muscular soreness, so I move around shake them up lots to feel and nothing but time with which to do so. Swing bounce in place shift the hips ribcage &amp; upper abdomen’s tightness tension. From the head down spinal tap through the stomach along the hip joints and oozing out by the leg-feet corridor. A steady shifting awareness I am here tuning in across spacetime. Rest, rest.

We finger screens and website trackers lift a fingerprint. Information aquifers are forming to replace the lost water. The network’s obscene metal wires carry user profiles across ocean floors while the spectacle flashes onscreen. We all leave traces in the cloud, on the ground.\nIs data an extension of ourselves and our private lives, or is it a commodity to be exchanged in a contract? Extralegal contract-bundles millions of words long provide “notice” and demand wholly uninformed consent to policies users are not meant to read, circumventing laws to create always-on global surveillance for the profit of corporate players. Each keystroke hides so much metadata production, surreptitiously lifted by the scripts encoded to the network we ping with our metal boxes, dripping into vast and unknown repositories held by data controllers.\nData, mined from bodies as surely as gold from the earth. As we sleep, bodies of data are scoured for useful information to exploit, to create an ever-more-precise graph of reality. It’s just words, numbers, symbols to represent the capacity for storing knowledge, machined to perform on command. Analysis of the stockpile goes on, ever accelerating, the bits of binary adding up to fine-grained categorizations of how populations think and consume, figuring out what me and my friends will want in the future.\nBehavioural data is computed to sell predictions, and digital oracles are increasingly accurate. Targeted ads are bought and sold based on nebulous speculation. Corporate internet giants utilize people to breed information, use it to reinforce the ideological norms of developers and shareholders collecting and disseminating data for economic profit and political power. It seems personal data is still treated with undue flippancy. I wonder how often something checks whether or not I am online.\nWhen did anyone consent to the digital dragnet? Just when the ocean consented to industrial fisheries. Suppose we treated our data as offspring. What if we cared for our data as for families, for lovers? Protected them, and kept them safe. Imagine personal data isn’t digital ether but flesh prone to tearing. Surely we must staunch the blood.\nThe p__rivacy paradox is the name given to discrepancies between expressed privacy concerns and actual online behaviour. Social scientific research finds that individuals follow their instincts when considering whether or not to share information, and do not necessarily assess potential security risks. Alternatively, someone may have considered the risks, but is unable to act in their best self-interest due to external factors, such as: low transparency, user unfriendly design, or consumer hostile privacy policies with all-or-nothing usage. Online companies mostly operate on a Notice-and-Choice legal doctrine. That is: because they provide us with a URL to their ‘privacy policy’ which discloses the specific ways in which our data will be used, users are considered to have been informed of the contract to which we are agreeing when we use a given service.\nPut simply: A person looking for involvement in life online is misled to discount potential worries about privacy. Individuals do what needs to be done in order to engage with our peers. I think the privacy paradox results in part from a sense of emotional detachment from our information. Is data too far out of the reach of our bodies for us to have any stake in its protection? What if we grew more attached to data, felt a connection akin to empathy? Would we be less reluctant to carry out the necessary actions of digital self-defence?\nI am trying to make sense of just how my body extends into the digital, just how it is usurped. Australian academic Gavin JD Smith named disembodied exhaust the “data trails that are either voluntarily or involuntarily emitted from the body as it interfaces with networked sensor technologies. Disembodied exhaust gives rise to a data-proxy, an abstracted figure created from the amalgamation of data traces.” Smith’s data-proxy expands the body’s boundaries to remake humanity in the shape of data. Metadata speaks louder than content in the digital realm, a clarion call for corporate attention.\nFlesh bodies tapped into the internet emit flows of information to an infrastructure of software and hardware. We hold no power over whether or not data is created about us, and can only choose how to respond, how to shape our relationships with data. A social networking algorithm’s task is to keep a user engaged, keep us clicking. It does not matter what I click, but that I click, or buy, or ask alexa a question, or drive a networked car. Whenever we interact with information technologies we enact a carefully engineered dissociation from our own data, accounting to the algorithms and analysts of the proverbial big-data playground. Behaviour is monitored, predicted, and influenced using data, and thus habits are reinforced in perpetual feedback loops.\nThere is no separating disembodied exhaust from our thoroughly enfleshed lives. I resign myself to accept a data-proxy as a part of my body today, but I refuse to consider my data lost in advance, to think myself wholly alienated from it. We must not consider data as a static object we discard, but always remember that it is iterative, flowing out in waves, existing in many places. Digital natives are not just the youth who’ve grown up browsing social networks, they are the populations of scavengers breaking down e-waste for scraps to eke out a living in the landfills of digital industry, while the consuming populace scrolls in outrage, shares a link, moves on.\nAll relationships are invaded by data, progressively reducing life on earth to forms of existence that can be shipped in packets and held in servers. The algorithm is in tune with a global pulse. Our own acts of knowledge making are consumed by networked scripts in a continuous accumulation. If data, created from all the actions we take online and many we take offline, is used to create a proxied version of ourselves, then data is not excess, it is the digital lifeblood of humanity.\nI am not after total invisibility or anonymity from the global surveillance state. That doesn’t seem like a viable option, nor is it necessary. What I am after is tracking evasion. It is enough for me that corporate advertisers do not have a line-perfect profile of my daily life anymore. It is enough that my digital fingerprint is somewhat blurred. The most effective form of digital resistance is disengagement from the dragnets of hegemonic social networks. Data proxies are artifacts, separated from factual life. Stop feeding them, and they slowly decay.\nCooperation is required to know what anyone is thinking, feeling. The mad and the sick learned long ago that subjective experience is the only realm impervious to the scientific gaze. Computers can tally up medical data and save lives without ever valuing the love and rage of sick people. Contact tracing is nothing new—it’s only recently deployed at scale. A smartphone makes patients of us all, turns the city into a hospital ward. What if individuals chose, actively, on an ongoing basis, when and where to disclose information? Identity, name, and body, legal and fixed, yet in flux. The recognizable markers of a citizen, archived privately by public institutions, access restricted to a select few concerned parties. I imagine a doctor’s consultation that begins with a patient plugging in a private key to unlock their own file within the hospital’s network. I imagine data relationships built upon principles of trust rather than commodity exchange. I imagine open-access libraries of information to make informed analysts of us all.\nAs I write this, every move made with a phone is tracked and turned into useful information. By accepting this, we may begin to relate to data not as digital waste existing in a digital landfill, but as an integral extension of our networked bodies. Data-bodies form by proxy through a digital tap tap tap consciousness upload, feeding algorithms hosted under heavy guard in server farms to rival industrial agriculture, while the earth fights humanity for its right to life. Bodies are subsumed by numbers and keywords, algorithms guess at how to best make users consume more of the information monoculture powered by fossils and rare earth metals.\nSensing data’s extension of the body requires evolving awareness of how data is harvested. Data-bodies are all trans, as they shift and evolve alongside the corporeal. Through the repetition of specified bodily acts, bodies are reworked. Identity is not an essence but an action. Knowing that cameras can ID passersby and that smartphones record our conversations is a rudimentary starting point. What is bodily sovereignty anymore? Who has absolute autonomy within the territory of their body? We are not merely watched beings.\nThe steps I take for digital self-defence are a matter of breathing clearly when I log on. Why should my personal research habits create profit for the digital ruling class? Why should my computing be a means of enabling my own exploitation? Why shouldn’t I have control over when and where information about me appears? By the most benign of activities, my own thought tendencies have surely got me on a list somewhere. So what? The more inflated the list of dissidents, the safer each individual. I’ll suspiciously browse Wikipedia all day long so that those conducting direct action online have more traffic to hide within. Online security tools must be taken up by everyone, so that we all become suspect. There is no overwhelming the surveillance algorithms, they are designed to collect everything. If that’s the case, everything ought to be done to make the filters pick up false positives.\nDigital self-defence spreads fog over the network. Simple tools are at every user’s disposal.

Digital self-defence is a meaningless concept to a vast population whose existence, in fact, makes possible my thinking about it. Writing on high-end laptop purchased with a student loan to facilitate my university education in a colony state, the solutions I find for myself are the result of mining and factory work on the other side of the globe, brought here by transoceanic shipping. Data itself is the map which directs resource extraction, controls factory floors, and routes the millions of containers. Digital self-defence is meaningless when there is no network, when payment for a day’s work is a bag of rice, when labour does not mean staring at a screen but breaking down ships on the shores of bangladesh. All these obscene realities make possible my writing, your reading. I don’t know what to do. So I write about the digital intangible on this little metal box.\n2023TransfusionRewrite\nscroll scroll scroll tap scroll click tap I Agree because what other choice is there for me?\nSucked whirling into the wrong abyss, and I hardly know what it is.\nClarification: In the digital world, we often find ourselves mindlessly scrolling through content and agreeing to terms and conditions without fully understanding the implications.

Page after page I was tossed into reams of hyperviolence on the front lines of climate havoc into a version of turtle island made unfamiliar by the passage of ambiguous time.

It’s thrilling. His stories advance at a breakneck pace, and span the globe over the oeuvre. Through the entertainment that are pop novels, he does not hesitate to depict child soldiers, starvation, racist assault, sexual exploitation.

I started keeping handwritten logs in 2016, once I learnt that I wouldn’t be allowed a laptop in certain university classrooms. A challenge turned into a blessing as I rapidly grew to love the process of scrawling.\nReading back, it’s fascinating how quickly my relationship to the act shifted. In May 2016, my handwriting was near illegible, the notes pointform, the questions vapid. It’s like I didn’t know what to do with a blank page. This much is obvious: practice breeds practice; writing is a habit and a muscle that builds with use.\nEarly on, the spontaneity of handwritten journaling won me over. I lived a routine of constantly running from home to class to work to various social engagements; the journal always lived in my bag. I got into using the same format over and over: an 8.5x11 flip-over with tear-out 3-hole lined paper, and a hard back. Excellent for scrawling out manic reflections on my day as I sat in the metro on the 45 minute commute to campus. The evolution of the journal’s content over just that first year reflects the beginning of my introspective journey.\nMany beginnings coalesce: Keeping a journal, meditation, reflection on a life of illness. In these early attempts to verbalize my experiences, I read frustration, and occasionally explicit fear and rage. 4 years is a short blip on long time-scales but in my early 20s it seems safe to say my consciousness evolved precipitously.\nIt’s painful to read some of the things I put down on the pages. I’m only glad most of those thoughts stayed private. My relationship to myself and the world around me was spiteful, loathsome. I recognize many of my worst impulses taking center stage in those notes. At the same time, certain seeds of the direction I’ve taken in life are apparent even then; I’m not a fundamentally different person, just more aligned with love.\nIn 2016 I lived anxiously, day in day out. Many an entry treats the discomfort of embodiment, the fear. I was living fuelled by caffeine and alcohol, still, and wondered why my body screamed warnings. I wasn’t yet ready to relax into the memories that arose when I let myself come to a position of rest. The memories of trauma are deep-seated and painful, breed terror and halt breath, but the process at least is one of healing.

Works Cited at the end of part 3. I hope you enjoy.\nFrom Vein to Vial and Back Again: Towards a Transcorporeal Theory of Intravenous Transfusion.\n\n“What are some routes from human corporeality to the flesh of the other-than-human and back again?”\nStacey Alaimo, ‘Trans-Corporeal Feminisms and the Ethical Space of Nature’ , in Material Feminisms (2008)\n\nThis essay is concerned with a particular goal: narrating one of human blood’s many trans-corporeal maps of transit, thus sketching one response to Stacey Alaimo’s question. With the fertile notion of transcorporeality, I’m navigating the human body’s material inextricability from its world. My focus is on blood plasma as it gets extracted, processed into a blood-product, and administered through intravenous transfusion. Plasma becomes ‘Privigen®’, an Immunoglobulin used to treat a number of illnesses; a liquid node in what has been termed the “haemato-global assemblage” by anthropologists. Human plasma is a part of so-called human flesh, of that liquid which moves within and keeps us alive, but where does plasma originate? Is it ‘from’ the bodies which physically produce it? And where does it go next? I have chosen this line of inquiry because I have previously been the recipient of this particular drug. I write here as an individual node among others in the haemato-global assemblage within which plasma exists.\nPlasma is a straw-colored liquid that carries red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Plasma is made up of water (about 90%), proteins and clotting factors (8%), and small amounts of salts, glucose (blood sugar) and lipids (fats). Plasma, separate from whole blood, is only accessible when carefully harvested by trained professionals using specialized equipment in a process called plasmapherisis. There is no synthetic plasma manufacturing to replace the human body. ‘Privigen® Immunoglobulin Intravenous (Human) 10% Solution for Infusion’ is one product amongst a class of drug called ‘IVIG’ for short, manufactured by the ‘Global Rare Disease Biotech Company’ CSL Behring, which collects “donated” plasma in over 170 centres across the US and Germany.\nLet us make no mistake: Healthcare is an industry and “health” is a political fiction. Both serve technocratic imperatives, founded on a model of the human body within which the organism is little more than a machine. Healthcare is one of the ways in which normalizing systems of oppression fabricate docile bodies; “health” is a fiction which states that a certain class of body is acceptable, and others are not. I am against the health-healthcare system as defined by practices and discourses that diffuse “pharmaceutical, governmental, insurance, and media interests” (Klein 15) rather than tend to the wellbeing of sick people. To be against health in this sense is to engage in a protest analytic, to deconstruct propagated mythologies.\nOn their website, CSL markets plasma as “A Potent Weapon Against Diseases,” and “A Life-Saving Solution,” which is “Tracked Every Step of the Way” as it makes its way from Plasma Collection Centres through Plasma Testing Laboratories located in Knoxville, TN, and Göttingen, Germany, as well as Plasma Logistics Centres in Indianapolis, IN, and Mesquite, TX. They explain the process thus:\n\n\nThese logistics centres are state-of-the art facilities… for receiving, storing, and shipping plasma that is donated at our collection centres. The inventory is controlled by sophisticated … software that is tied into our donor management computer system … The Laboratories test millions of plasma samples each year, ensuring the safety of the plasma … we have “vein to vial” control, tracing each plasma unit from the initial donation, to laboratory test results, to logistics and on to the fractionation facilities—and ultimately to the product made from the plasma you donate. (Testing and Processing Plasma)\n\n\nNearly 70% of the world’s supply of plasma originates from the United States, which is the only country in the world to be “totally self-sufficient” in plasma-products with a “mostly for-profit plasma industry” (Slonim et al. 185). CSL Plasma’s donors in the U.S are pulled into “donation” by the lure of “Make Cash, Save Lives,” in that order (Video: ‘Make Cash, Save Lives’). The language used in articulating the act of plasma “donation” is gravely misleading. A plasma donor’s interiority is drawn out and stretched across the haemato-global assemblage’s complexes of capital accumulation, ongoing systematic oppression, and dispossession. Plasma Collection Centres choose to call the sale of bodily material a donation, linking it to acts which people undertake for no monetary compensation, tellingly revealing the industry’s desire to appear as falling in line with the purported moral values of Healthcare. The campaign to incite donations is one by which people are encouraged to willfully divest themselves of their plasma, so that it may be rendered as raw biological material to be exploited for capital gain. Perhaps it would be more appropriate to call these clinics Plasma Extraction Centres, since extraction demands dividends from raw material. Yet the firms do not market themselves as extracting surplus from the bodies of their “donors.” Explicitly reminding ourselves that the companies are driven by profit opens them back up to a certain critique of the industry of health.\nBy aligning themselves with healthcare, a plasma collection firm renders their operating strategy opaque. According to the rhetoric deployed, the system is in place to grant “donors” the privilege of doing good. Technoscientific capitalism would have us believe there is no wrong in the necessity for certain low-income individuals to sell their plasma in order to pay bills. The onus of choice is apparently placed on the individuals “donating,” but many living in precarity have no other options. This profit-driven branch of the haemato-global assemblage renders the body’s interiority into a wholesale product, constructing a multibillion dollar industry out of “donations.” This essay currently lacks the work and scope necessary to explore specific ways in which this assemblage works to erase histories of White-settler-master colonialism in the americas and elsewhere.\nIn the marketing of these centres, “donors” appear as an undifferentiated class of people, without accounting for the uneven distribution of risk, of differential governance across empire. Donors are all subject to pharmacopornographic apparatus, wherein power’s tendrils exist with/in the human body through “soft, biomolecular and digital technologies” (P. B. Preciado 142, [my translation]). “Healthcare” is the pretense upon which this system operates. “Health” is the fiction which is mobilized each day to allow this. Plasma donor bodies, sick bodies, health and healthcare are all component parts in the wider haemato-global assemblage. I propose that we bring the notion of the assemblage into trans-corporeal territories, allowing for plasma’s material agency in becoming and transfusing Privigen®.\n\nPart 2: 2021-01-21-veintovial_2\nPart 3: 2021-01-28-veintovial_3\n"},"2021/01/2021-01-21-veintovial_2":{"slug":"2021/01/2021-01-21-veintovial_2","filePath":"2021/01/2021-01-21-veintovial_2.md","title":"Vein to Vial (Part 2/3)","links":[],"tags":["blog-essay-transfusion"],"content":"In Bodily Natures, Stacey Alaimo sets the stage for thinking blood trans-corporeally. She draws out blood’s entanglements with family, state violence, and environmental racism, noting how “scientific apprehensions of material reality become embodied, historically entangled pursuits,” making one’s blood more than just one’s own (70). Alaimo takes up Karen Barad’s notion of quantum “intra-action” in order to mark the coming-into-being of agents in their relationality.\nAll assemblages, already constituted by the co-becoming of relations, are also trans-corporeal assemblages wherein all agencies exist in a web of mutual intra-actions. Crucially, the move to think assemblages trans-corporeally means that no assemblage occupies a closed territory. Still, intra-actions remain most noticeable at sites of transfer, where the opening of a new territory is explicit. On our map, the intravenous needle is one such site.\nIn Deleuze and Guattari’s terms, it is the “machine” which holds the key, the “cutting edge” (333-334) inserting itself into the assemblage of the donor’s body and drawing out their blood. It becomes plasma as part of a continuous trans-corporeal “deterritorialization passing from one assemblage to another” (306). During donation, as blood moves up the plastic tubes, it expands from the original assemblage of the donor’s body into the territories of biotechnology and medicine.\nMany possibilities for becoming are opened up to blood by its intra-action with the intra-venous needle. Thinking blood plasma’s transit through the haemato-global assemblage trans-corporeally allows that while the plasma’s ontological state changes when it is harvested as raw biological material, the resulting blood-product is still charged with the historical entanglements which have shaped the lives of the people from whose bodies the plasma is extracted.\nThe intra-venous needle is a tool manufactured to transit blood into the realm of medicine, where it may be used, examined, engineered, measured, quantified, processed, and altered. In opening the vein, the needle has served its human purpose. While blood moves through the needle into a world of possibilities, the needle comes into being through a narrow technoscientific focus. A transitory, ephemeral vessel for blood, an intra-venous needle is designed as a single-use object. A sterile puncturing device made of steel, wrapped in plastic, only useful in conjunction with the haemato-global assemblage’s innumerable operative relations. In Baradian terms, the material-discursive practices. (more on Baradian intra-action’s implications for blood in a later blog post).\nYet, as soon as the blood flow has been deemed sufficient, the needle is withdrawn from the body and disposed of. It gets thrown away, along with all else the blood has traversed, into a specially marked bin: Biohazard. So the needle’s journey continues into unknown trash-heaps and land-fills, for that which human blood has touched is considered too dangerous for re-use. No machine is needed to open or close a trans-corporeal assemblage—the flow is uninterrupted, only the map changes. A puncture wound under a plaster on a donor’s arm is but one visible mark. Paths may shift but assemblages, in all their material-discursive situatedness, enact the relations which create “word, flesh, and dirt” as “no longer discrete” (Alaimo “Trans-Corporeal Feminisms” 256). Plasma is the substance of human life, othered by its capture into the trans-corporeal haemato-global assemblage of more-than-human intra-actions."},"2021/01/2021-01-25-private-blog":{"slug":"2021/01/2021-01-25-private-blog","filePath":"2021/01/2021-01-25-private-blog.md","title":"Why Blog Privately?","links":[],"tags":["blog"],"content":"Because I’m tired of feeling like I’m writing for others.

Mingled bloodlines and chemical-industrial processes intra-act, creating relationality in blood-plasma becoming Privigen®. Intravenous Immunoglobulin products are “prepared from the serum of between 1000 and 15000 donors per batch” (Jolles et al. 1), while Privigen®’s product monograph simply states that it is “prepared from large pools of human plasma” (CSL Behring 26). For each individual recipient, “donors” are unknowable and numerous.\nPrivigen®’s liquid becoming is the result of its many passages among bodies, single-use needles, tubes, plasmapheresis machines, laboratories, de-pathologizing agents, sterile bottles, warehouses, transport vehicles moving blood-products across borders many bodies are disallowed crossing, and finally hospitals and clinics worldwide. Plasma each time takes on a new liquid form dictated by its position in trans-corporeal time-space, sloshing about in bottles yet always carrying the multiple histories which brought plasma into becoming. By the time it reaches the treatment space and hangs above an infusion pump, plasma is part of a “clear or slightly opalescent, colorless to pale yellow solution,” “a highly purified product” (CSL Behring 23, 39). The processes which make possible the becoming Privigen® of plasma are a series of attempts on the part of medical science to strip plasma of its material agency. This is exemplary “thingification,” which in Alaimo’s usage is “the reduction of lively, emergent, intra-acting phenomena into passive, distinct resources for human use and control” (Alaimo ‘Trans-Corporeal Feminisms’ 249).\nThe trans-corporeally assembled liquid becomes Privigen® by a trick of the word, an immaterial coercion. In naming Privigen® as such, word and flesh are inextricable. An incorporeal change creates medicine, and harvested plasma makes Privigen®’s “(Human)” a misnomer, an obfuscation. The language of Privigen’s monograph is couched in tacit erasure of material-discursive histories which have long shaped what and who gets to be “Human.” The blood-product does not shed these histories as it undergoes biochemical apparatus and traverses inter-national and trans-corporeal borderlands. All this, a fraction of the treatment assemblage for patients whose sick bodies need help.\nBack into human corporeality through a new needle, down the intra-venous drip from the infusion pump and the sterile containers in which Privigen® first dwells, the crystalline substance comes into another biological body at last. Taking the human body and blood-product as active agents wrought with the inescapable desire to fuse, the haemato-global assemblage’s own material significance exists in trans-fusion. ‘Fusion’ stresses the loss of identity of the original concoction and implies oneness and indissolubility. Privigen® soon disappears and turns “Human” again within these new veins. Co-mingling with this new host, plasma-cum-Privigen® finds a trans-corporeal body different from the thousands it has inhabited. Plugged into the infusion pump, the patient has submitted their human body to the clinical environment.\nThe assimilation the body conducts as it is trans-fused is accompanied by an array of multisensory socio-technological and chemical reactions. The patient’s experience of transfusion confers upon them a uniquely embodied knowledge of trans-corporeality. The patient’s body must successfully assimilate the Privigen®, though it may resist the transfusion, exhibiting medical side-effects perhaps sensed by the patient as negative embodiment. Risks for the patient body are the driving factor determining the speed of the transfusion. Dizziness, migraines, bodily pain, fever, and anxiety are all common affects to which a patient must grow accustomed as they inevitably recur during a set of treatments (Perez et al. S28-30, CSL Behring 4, 38). Due to the risk of the body rejecting the medication, the patient and the Privigen® are to be carefully monitored by a nurse whose actions are determined by the biotechnologies and medical expertise inherent to the encounter. The pumps and monitors are in place to carefully regulate the body’s intake of fluids flowing down the intra-venous drip. The patient is asked to sit back, breathe, and allow the requisite time to pass.\nThe unpredictable treatment demands an awareness of one’s own existence in the world, co-becoming with the machines, the drugs, and the medical professionals all around and all implicated in the trans-corporeal haemato-global assemblage. As assemblages themselves are always becoming with their component parts, the process of trans-fusion is one by which Privigen® and the sick body bring their respective assemblages of trans-corporeal being to bear, simultaneously making the Privigen® “human” again and othering the human patient with the haemato-global assemblage’s trans-fusion.\nThe seemingly solitary experience of transfusion treatment is shattered by acknowledging that Privigen® delivers the material-semiotic histories of the thousands of unknowable “donors” whose plasma contributed to the preparation. The extraction of plasma is perhaps trans-corporeal abstraction in its conversion of human matter into blood-product, and sick bodies receive the material results directly within their veins. The bodies at play in this meeting are material agents charged with material histories, but Patients are not necessarily aware of the systemic violence and ongoing oppressions which create the haemato-global assemblage as industry. Patients whose wellbeing depends on an indefinite supply of blood-plasma becoming-Prigiven® are often in the privileged position of being able not to ask too many questions about the functioning of the system keeping them healthy. The obfuscation of patient knowledge may be crucial to the operation of the health-healthcare system. If all the histories which charge Privigen were Known, people might revolt, refuse treatment, hurt profits. That knowledge may be also be too much, for how can one body bear the violence enacted upon thousands?\n\nWorks Cited\nAlaimo, Stacy. Bodily Natures: Science, Environment, and the Material Self.

We must learn that healing is ongoing even in illness, that there is no teleological cure-all, that inner listening, rest, and time off are necessary for survival, that we are simultaneously responsible for our own touch-starved selves and all those with whom we conspire.\nAwash in limbo, battered by winter, my project continues to be concerned with the details of auto-immunity. This is my lot. But sickness extends beyond the blood, and will not be contained by any such essentializing. Treating such complexities with words poses the significant risk of remaining too abstract, when illness is anything but. Sickness is of the dirt and water, the breath, the bones. Sickness is felt in the chemical agonists acting on my spine’s liquid marrow, the crystalline substrate of life. Why write of sickness? Because we have so much to learn from the sickness of the trees, the birds, the frogs. Because limbo is not merely a human concern.\nSo how do we dwell here? How do we inhabit our own lives when the hourglass is shattered? What makes the sick umwelt livable in the long-term at the scale of the globe?\nWithout that imperative to affirm: “I am healthy,” a sick existence may breed wondrous life. We need fresh clay with which to mold our bodies. Reams of blank paper upon which to compose symphonies of flesh. The possibilities are not so remote. What if we are in fact headed towards universal flourishing, an eternally recurring eden? Not a circle of hell, but a quiet place, a simple place. Not the void, just somewhere to gather and sing songs.\n\nThe things of this world\n\n\nexist, they are;\n\n\nyou can’t refuse them.\n\n\n(Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching)\n\nMy life is devoted to the ongoing attempt at acceptance of this simple verse. I do not refuse sickness, I do not refuse the collapse of so much I took for granted. I strive for love in limbo, and accept that which I cannot control, to better make meaning from those minuscule decisions that shape each day. Yet, the more things change…\nI am still bleeding. I still take pills and attempt to make sense of this bodily enigma. I know I am not alone in this, even if isolated in the cold. Back outside, the storm has thickened. Across the hospital parking lot, I can’t see the water from the cliff. On a clear day the visibility stretches, rounding the horizon. Back to walking, foot after foot, down, north, down the same path I followed up, cradling my arm to staunch the pinpoint wound, wondering whether it will leave a bruise.\n\nThis post eventually became an essay published in carte blanche, and won me the runner-up position for the 2021 QWF carte blanche prize.

My heart knows that\nreliving these events won’t be easy for me, and would almost rather keep\nsilent, not bother sharing. With the encouragement and support of many\nfriends, I take a step forward, and begin.\n\n\nIt was 2001, high summer near the Salish Sea of Turtle Island’s Pacific\nnorthwest. So-called Vancouver, British Columbia. I was 5 years old.\nLife was a series of forest adventures, pre-school friendships, and\ncreative curiosities held warmly by my single mother’s devotion to\nraising a child alone in her 40s. Being from colonized Gespe’gewa’gi on\nthe opposite ocean’s shore, she had made home in Vancouver during an\nearly adulthood spent traveling the world, fuelled by pure curiosity.\nShe was ready to have a child. Though her lover decided he couldn’t be a\nfather, she chose to become a mother.\n\n\nSurrounded by friends, she brought me into a world full of infinite\npossibility. She recounted myths and fed my love of story. We laughed to\nthe point of tears as she read me kid-friendly renditions of the\njudeo-christian tradition; we imagined a world of justice and love, as\nshe nourished us both with tales of equality and ecology—new myths for\na changing planet.\n\n\nI remember the story of a young princess, dark of skin, who ventures\ninto the enchanted forest. She gets lost, lost in her fear of the woods,\nfear she received from her father. So the guardians of the ancient\ngroves, a dragon and a unicorn, show her how the forest is a place of\nbeauty. When the princess returns home, she shows her father, and he\nrecognizes his daughter’s wisdom. He changes his ways. He stops\ndestroying the forest.\n\n\nI grew up feeling like the forest held all the world’s magic, all its\nwisdom. I knew this to be the truth. My home was an environment in which\nthis ecstatic curiosity and passion for the world, its arts, its\nstories, could flourish.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many things my mother did not know, but she transmitted the\npieces that mattered. She underscored that in all the stories, and in\nall our relations, the uniting, healing force, the bridge across enmity\nand the conflictual sense of separateness, is love. As she shared the\nstories of Adam, Abraham, Moses, she did not have the biting historical\ncomparative-mythology political-philosophy gender-studies critique I\nwould develop two decades later, when I went back to the scripture. Her\nlove of God was as simple and as pure as her love of a child she named\nMatthieu-Xavier Marin. After the apostle, whose name she made a point of\ntelling me means “gift from god”—and her own father, François-Xavier, a\nGaspésien through-and-through, a heavy machinery mechanic whose career\nwas spent in Murdochville’s copper mine.\n\n\nIt was 2001, and I was 5 years old. Summer was coming to a head, the\ntemperate rainforest soaked up the sun’s rays. My days were filled with\nplay, with harmless games. One of those days, my friend and I were\nbrought to a seaside market gift-shop. My memories of Vancouver’s\nmarkets are fond. I remember the smell of salt on the air, the smoked\nsalmon, the honey candies. I remember the seagulls arguing over the\nleftover fries from the fish n’ chips stalls. I can still taste the\nmango sorbet.\n\n\n\n\nThis story begins by accident.\n\n\n“We can’t treat this,”\n\n\ntold us the walk-in clinic attendant,\n\n\n“go to the hospital.”\n\n\nAnd so we did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions For A Blood Doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere once was a boy.\n\nNo, that’s not quite the word.\n\n\n\n\nThere once was a pussy willow lounging in the reeds\n\n\nwith nowhere to call but home\n\n\nwhen the days ran out of tune\n\n\nlike the great-grandfather’s marine band harp,\n\n\nrusty with a half-century’s dis-use,\n\n\nstill sounded crystal clear carrion call\n\n\non the neatly tended forest path\n\n\nwide, and cleared by hundreds of feet each day.\n\n\n\n\nAt a glance no wilds remain here.\n\n\nSo she buys a new harmonica\n\n\nthe same model, tuned to G\n\n\nIt don’t sound the same.\n\n\nWithin a day the 3rd reed broke\n\n\n(won’t play on the inhale)\n\n\nbut she don’t give up because\n\n\nthe harp’s got something to teach\n\n\nher diaphragm about waking up to use,\n\n\nwhat’s more it seems like a neat campfire\n\n\nside doodad to pluck from a pocket\n\n\nwhen the time is ripe.\n\n\n\n\nAlways thinking about how to gather\n\n\naround the fire, now that I’ve had\n\n\na taste again. Israel was\n\n\nthe man’s name, we spoke for hours\n\n\nletting our tongues weave new\n\n\nold folklore for the current apocalypse,\n\n\nstories tuned to the beat of the tongue-drum\n\n\nwith only beauty and time on our hands,\n\n\nthough liquor too in his case,\n\n\nnot mine.\n\n\n\n\nHow could I keep doing this,\n\n\nif I had to to do it forever?\n\n\nI remember to pray. Do it over again.\n\n\nRepeat, reread, rewrite.\n\n\nBow, and remember reverence.\n\n\nAgain, again. Practice { }\n\n\nDon’t presume to know what the day holds.\n\n\n\n\nIf it were simple maybe I’d need not repeat myself\n\n\nand repeat myself. If it were complex\n\n\nmaybe saying it once would suffice\n\n\nto anchor the pattern.\n\n\nIf there were a perceptible logic\n\n\nthen simplicity would occur.\n\n\nBut, no, logic breeds the complicated\n\n\nthe reasoned, the interminable excuses.\n\n\nSimple is the path to health, one breath at a time,\n\n\none refusal after another.\n\n\nI still don’t want your cure, Doctor.\n\n\nI still think you’ve got it wrong, Doctor.\n\n\nLet’s grab a drink and laugh about it.\n\n\nLet’s get down to the business\n\n\nof coming to terms with impending,\n\n\nongoing collapse. What’s the matter, doctor?\n\n\nWas that a threat?\n\n\n\n\nYou tell me that if so-called alternative treatment fails,\n\n\nI may not be get back on these meds?\n\n\nYou say that the adjudicators are only human,\n\n\nand so their reasoning may be:\n\n\n“Oh, well, if they wanted to go try natural medicine,\n\n\nwhy should we re-approve this expense?”\n\n\nDoctor, I am confused.\n\n\nWhy is it that my desire to seek other care\n\n\nmay later be punished?\n\n\nHumans, you say?\n\n\nNo, I am not so sure the impulse driving bureaucrats\n\n\nis a human agenda.\n\n\n\n\nTell me doctor,\n\n\nhow quickly do we fall through the cracks once our dissent is known\n\n\nto the legalese-fluent contract-dependent policy-breathing sort?\n\n\nHow little does it take for us to get blacklisted?\n\n\nOne misstep, or two?\n\n\nI say, Doctor, your thinly veiled threat sits with me.\n\n\nYou wish me luck and pawn me off\n\n\nto a specialist nearer-by\n\n\nas if you haematologists treat bodies, not numbers.\n\n\nYou make me sick, don’t make me laugh.\n\n\nNo, I would not rather be healthy, no thanks to you.\n\n\n\n\nHere, take some clonazepam, you’ll\n\n\nquickly feel better, then worse, then\n\n\ntake another, and soon enough\n\n\nthe numbness will forestall all\n\n\ncapacity for worry. Come on, let’s\n\n\ngo for a joyride. Oil’s pricey, sure,\n\n\nbut on your specialists’ salary?\n\n\nIndulge a bit. Get a friend\n\n\nto write that prescription for you\n\n\nsure beats sitting in a waiting room,\n\n\nwaiting to see the psych,\n\n\nknowing a fabulous act\n\n\nis about to be put on display.\n\n\nDepression’s a game we play\n\n\non stage, hide behind a mask\n\n\nof lights and pills, and whisper\n\n\ninto the lonely pillow at\n\n\nthe end of the 80 hour work week.\n\n\n\n\nOrientation’s finding your way,\n\n\nfeeling at home goes unnoticed\n\n\nuntil lost, disorientation results. Lost,\n\n\nunable to navigate and find my way.\n\n\n\n\nI do not know how I’m supposed to relate to my body.\n\n\nIt is mine with which to do as I please,\n\n\nto care for and mutilate and experiment with.\n\n\nYet I am at a loss, learning\n\n\nto navigate tides of being.\n\n\n\n\nA sick body is a magical labyrinth,\n\n\nfull of shifting corridors and dead ends.\n\n\nTo orient myself in this world, I rely on this labyrinth.\n\n\nI trust that it will guide me where we need to go.\n\n\nI am not the architect, only a passenger.\n\n\n\n\nA life lived through medicine is an incomplete form of existence,\n\n\none which foregoes so much agency,\n\n\nwhich must trust in the expertise\n\n\nof sometimes personally disagreeable individuals.\n\n\nThe architects thus far have been\n\n\nthose whose signatures prescribe my physiology.\n\n\nBeing diagnosed and treated is akin\n\n\nto a long game of pin the tale on the donkey,\n\n\nwhere the patient is both blindfolded and the donkey itself.\n\n\n\n\nWho better to undertake the journey through the depths?\n\n\nA glacier mountain ridge-line crawling single-file\n\n\nwith pilgrims seeking a detour and a view.\n\n\nEmbraced by the cold morning.\n\n\nDo go carefully, ye who seek alleged salvation.\n\n\nAre we not living beings?\n\n\nWhat greater opportunity for joy?\n\n\nThe inner grammar of sensation resounds\n\n\nwith gnosis if ye only tune to listen.\n\n\nThere is much embedded in the texts\n\n\nwhich drive my striving, but perhaps the answers\n\n\nbetter yet, the questions\n\n\nreside merely in the flesh borne of mother’s womb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nI am\nlooking\nat an image.\n\nA single page photocopy of an informational handout.\n\n\nIt is titled “General Guidelines for the Management of a Child with ITP”\n\n\nIn all likelihood, it was among the first documents that Maman received\nfrom healthcare professionals after my diagnosis in 2001, and it appears\nto be directed at schoolteachers. It’s a little bit outdated. Most\nnotably, ITP is now called ‘Immune Thrombocytopenia’ rather than\n‘Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura’, and there are more treatment\noptions than two decades ago.\n\n\nWriting in 2019, I have had an ITP diagnosis for 18 years.\n\n\nResearch from 2018 estimates that immune thrombocytopenia is found in\n8.8 out of 100’000 children.\n\n\nThe same research also finds that in 25% of ITP cases, the condition\nbecomes chronic, persistent: it does not simply go away. New diagnosis:\nChronic Immune Thrombocytopenia, found in 2.2 out of 100’000 children.\n\n\n\n\nI’m struck by a particular choice of words in the pamphlet:\n\n\n“benign disease.”\n\n\nMedical conditions are called benign to suggest they are not dangerous\nor serious. Benign can also mean kind, or kindly. I am one of the few\nwhose so-called benign disease turned into the chronic form.\n\n\nAs if auto-immunity were ever benign.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first months of treatment\n\n\nfrom August 10 2001 to May 14 2002,\n\n\nI received steroids,\n\n\nintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),\n\n\nPrednisone,\n\n\n51 blood tests,\n\n\nRho(D) immune globulin (RhIG)\n\n\nDexamethasone,\n\n\na bone marrow biopsy,\n\n\nand had my spleen removed.\n\n\n\n\nAfter which, I took penicillin\n\n\n(NOVO-PEN-VK 500 300MG)\n\n\ndaily\n\n\nfor a decade.\n\n\n(wikipedia: Phenoxymethylpenicillin)\n\n\nTreatment is still only ever palliative,\n\n\nmeaning that doctors manage symptoms\n\n\nbut do not seek a cure.\n\n\nMy ITP has always been around,\n\n\nand anytime my immune system is activated,\n\n\nit seeks out and destroys my platelets.\n\n\nPlatelets are an essential clotting factor.\n\n\n\n\nAuto-immunity is endlessly alienating and confusing. As a kid, I\nunderstood logically that I ‘was sick’ and might someday ’get better’\nbut was wholly unequipped to deal with the emotional and psychological\nrepercussions of living with a body that may or may not be bleeding at\nall times.\n\n\nThink of it this way: my body is a black box and my veins are\nSchrödinger’s cat.\n\n\nThe handout also has a very limited definition of “life style” but does\ncapture the restrictions imposed upon the child. Immunosuppressed to\navoid self-destruction, disallowed bodily contact sports to avoid\npotential external dangers. I was an isolated kid, but I don’t mean to\nsound down about it all. I turned out alright, but yeah, it sucked at\nthe time.\n\n\nThis document provided general information and guidelines for managing\nme, the child with ITP. It was intended for adults to have at least a\nvague sense of what was Wrong™ with me and adjust their treatment\naccordingly. As far as I recall, I never got a handout. Or counselling,\nuntil I sought it out myself 15 years down the line.\n\n\nIt is my intention in this book to vulgarize and translate my experience\nof illness in such a way as to be informative and engaging. I am telling\nyou a story. I want to share what I’ve been through, in the hope that my\nwords will resonate with others. I am not a doctor, I was a patient.\n\n\nIn attempting to show the research I do, I may get things wrong.\n\n\nI ask that you forgive such errors as you notice,\n\n\nand engage in a dialogue with me.\n\n\nThanks to Maman’s record keeping, I have a filing cabinet of my medical\ntranscripts, letters, general information and the like, which covers\nmost of my childhood post-diagnosis.\n\n\nThis is where I begin to disentangle it. I am setting out on an\narchaeological dig of the medical knowledge that was produced about me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019-09-27\n\n\nFrom The Hospital On The Day Of The Climate March\n\n\n\n\nAt the oncology-haematology clinic, \nthe wait time was only about 8 minutes.\n\nThe CHUM’s 14th floor waiting room’s got a wall of windows\n\n\ninto the azure and the river.\n\n\nPortable FM feeds my earbuds live coverage of the day’s main event.\n\n\nA guest-host panders to us all, repeating that everyone has limits they\nmust face, that we must all contend with ourselves and do what we can\nwithin our communities, that one of the great projects for anyone who is\nalive right now is to try being as human as possible within dehumanizing\nsystems.\n\n\nBlood test took all of 30 seconds.\n\n\nRoutine.\n\n\n\n\nNext, 12 floors down, tucked away above the main entrance, lounges\nGastroenterology, where the blue room has no windows. I checked in\nearly, 10:12, hopeful I’d have some energy left over to march.\n\n\nFinally, noon, was not greeted by a doctor.\n\n\nThe desk clerk asks me: “Can you come back next week?”\n\n\nDue to a system error, the MD wasn’t notified of my arrival.\n\n\nSo the time had passed. She couldn’t see me.\n\n\nNext week? Huh. Ok.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least I have the institutional note from the day of the climate\nmarch.\n\n\nI stayed tuned in to radio coverage as I left the hospital, north then\nwest, arrived at Saint-Laurent metro, and watched the crowd.\n\n\nHeard it and and its cries many minutes before\n\n\neyes glimpsed details of its millipede limbs over groaning asphalt.\n\n\nContingents of friends singers dancers rolling, celebrating,\n\n\nall blended into the marching worm wafting\n\n\ndespair\n\n\nand jouissance.\n\n\nSticking from the ground were red and yellow metal acoustic tubes,\n\n\ndistorting and delaying the cheers and chants.\n\n\nThere, in the streets, bidding farewell to the earth,\n\n\nwere so many of us, it is haunting.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s bitter irony I have not yet resolved\n\n\nin facing obstacles to action imposed by a body\n\n\nhaving only just the energy to survive and remain calm.\n\n\nDoubtless, many of the people attending\n\n\nto waiting rooms that day wished to be demonstrating instead.\n\n\nWe too wanted to feel a part of a seething mass.\n\n\nInstead, we patiently sat in chairs, awaiting expert examination,\n\n\nhoping our bodily prognosis is better than that of this earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA slow gunmetal ooze creeps like magma\n\n\nbut does not glow or emit its warmth.\n\n\nPressure mounts in my chest a clarion-call\n\n\nnoiseless signal that life remains, pains and all.\n\n\nAwake to the body’s below-all-the-dust and roses there\n\n\nexists a self which, shaped by the world, surpasses it.\n\n\nTranscendent to the last day. A self a precious few find\n\n\nthanks to the forces of circumstance.\n\n\nAnchored and buoyed along the path I am\n\n\nsoothed in my frenzied preparations by reminders to slow down.\n\n\nMy lifeline in a frenzy of deadlines is continuous\n\n\nawareness that the worlds within me sap the world.\n\n\nEach new attempt is faced with greater knowledge\n\n\nand skill. Baggage is a dirty word, but with it comes\n\n\na survival guide. Tools of the mind and soul\n\n\nto equip and take on life’s trials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hear within myself: You are not doing enough.\n\n\nThat voice may always be there.\n\n\nThere is no other way to exist in a world that is ending\n\n\nbut community support.\n\n\nNothing to be done except mutual aid,\n\n\nthe creation of spaces for grief and joy.\n\n\nSo what now?\n\n\nPerhaps calm is a coping mechanism,\n\n\nbecause to lose calm is to fall far, deep, lost.\n\n\nunsustainable emotions when there are bills due on the 1st.\n\n\nI just try to get enough sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Chameleon Ethic\n\n\n\n\nParallels can be drawn between trans experience and chronic\nillness,\nbut making up a list won’t get at the truth of it.\nSo many knots in my chest leave me uneasy.\nI try to sit with them and feel them out\nbut untangling roots is often more than I can do alone.\nI try not to retreat into numbness, with its familiar haze.\nWhen I let myself numb to life, I lose the magic that is: feeling.\nEmotions are exhausting, but at least they are true.\nI’ve been sick so long that I forget what an effect illness has on life.\nLet me be clear, when I say illness, I don’t mean an occasional\ncold/flu.\nI mean long-term, recurring, full of unknowns\nno matter how many test results pile up in a file.\nWhen I speak of illness I mean the ever-present sense of bodily doubt,\nof not knowing whether it will ever be possible to trust my body.\nRadical Left politics of anti-ableism would have me accept my illness.\nMy leanings toward a zen worldview would as well.\nBut how can I possibly be equanimous?\nMy mind is riddled with self-judgement at my body’s\ninability to keep up, ever after all the years.\n\n\nI figure maybe I’ll Get Better.\n\nBetter implying an inherent lack in sick bodies.\n\n\nBetter positing that sick bodies are\n\nunable to conduct themselves in valuable ways.\n\nBetter stating that illness is morally\n\ninferior to health, and so it is for its bearer.\n\nBetter implying that a body’s worth is\n\ndetermined by their ability to generate surplus value.\n\nBetter making clear that value only exists\n\noutside the cycle of chronic illness.\n\nBetter saying that there is no value\n\nin the process of perpetual healing.\n\nBetter affirming\n\n“you’d be happier if you were healthy.”\n\nBetter reminding us that sick bodies are\n\nto be pitied for their state of being.\n\nWhat is truly meant when stating Get Better is:\n\nget back to work.\n\n\n\nI say I don’t “function properly”, as if my body were a machine\n\n\n“Keep up”, as if I’m running a footrace and my body is dragging down the\nteam.\n\n\nThe truth is that my body can not and will not\n\n\never operate at any rhythm or capacity other than its own.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve burned out every other year since turning 18,\n\n\nand each time I get back on my feet after some period of unproductivity,\n\n\nI wonder how to better make Being Productive a sustainable endeavour.\n\n\n\n\nMy thinking is inherently flawed,\n\n\nand is the result of capital’s insidious grasp over my mind.\n\n\nInherently flawed, because I am thinking about my body as the problem,\n\n\nas a puzzle to be cracked.\n\n\n\n\nIf I only eat right, exercise, meditate, don’t drink, take my meds,\nsleep 9 hours a night…\n\n\nTHEN I’ll Be Better enough to exist frictionlessly.\n\n\nInjunctions such as Be Well turn the well-meaning speaker\n\n\ninto a prophet upholding morality, that false virtue of health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey tell you to be well\n\n\nand parrot the priestly call to piety.\n\n\nHow many patients internalize a narrative\n\n\nof illness as punishment for some wrongdoing?\n\n\nThe end of that story is cure through repentance.\n\n\n\n\nMy desire to get better is only rivalled by my rage at the\ninescapability of the system\n\n\nthat perpetually makes unsustainable demands of all bodies,\n\n\nsick or otherwise, human or otherwise, living or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nI try to develop all the right habits and I still find myself in crisis.\nI scramble for self-preservation only to find that everyone else is\nsinking too. No amount of internalized wellness rhetoric changes that my\nbody is prone to random bouts of self-destruction, that the structures\nthat guide labour and consumption as they exist today make no\naffordances for predictably unpredictable health. I work 40 hours a week\nbecause it seems like the thing to do. Because is seems like having a\nsteady paycheck that lets me do more than just survive may be worth it.\n\n\n\n\nBut what is it really worth?\n\n\nIs it worth my mental health to take any job with a salary and\ndissociate 8 hours a day?\n\n\nIs it worth the energy commitment, not having enough left over\n\n\nto see my loved ones even kind of regularly?\n\n\nIs it worth the feelings of isolation that comes with being\n\n\na closeted trans in a Progressive™ office environment?\n\n\nThe kind of place that has social-inclusion policies in place, though\ntheir efficacy is doubtful at best.\n\n\nIs it worth creating friction in the system in order to Live My\nIdentity?\n\n\nOr would my identity be better lived elsewhere?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I write this, I’m about to embark on an overnight laxative journey\n\n\nin order to adequately prepare myself for a colonoscopy\n\n\nscheduled tomorrow morning.\n\n\nA look inside my bowels to check if I’m bleeding.\n\n\nThey’re looking for the cause of my anemia,\n\n\nas if ITP wasn’t enough of an answer.\n\n\nI suppose that Medically Speaking, it isn’t.\n\n\nIt had been over 2 years since I last visited with the\ngastroenterologist, and our meeting lasted less than 10 minutes. Dr.\nGuts looked at my numbers and evinced confusion:\n\n\n“Your iron is still low,” she said,\n\n\n“and… your platelets jumped from 19 to 427 last April.”\n\n\n“Yes,” I confirmed, “I rested that month.”\n\n\n“Your platelets shot that high because you…rested?”\n\n\n“Yes, that’s what I said.”\n\n\nMy platelets were low when I checked into the ER in late that one night\nin March 2019 due to high fever. I spent the night sitting under\nfluorescents in a half-lotus, listening, taking in the noise. My regular\nblood doctor was the attendant haematologist, and he upped my regular\nmeds when he got around to my hallway-bound cot at 7am the next morning.\nSo in April the meds I was taking everyday were doing their thing, too.\nMy haematologist and I have a decent working relationship. He’s followed\nmy case since I was 19, he knows what my body’s up to.\n\n\nDr. Guts, the gastroenterologist, I saw for the first time in 2017 when\nby her careful hand tubes with cameras insinuated through me to check\nwhether some part of my large intestine or bowels was bleeding. They\nwere not. The experience was deeply troubling. Perhaps some of you have\nbeen through this procedure: Drugged to near-total dissociation with\nfentanyl, I was out cold for the majority of the invasion. I had a\nsingle moment of lucidity. My oesophagus was occupied by plastic, my\nintestine shifting uneasily to accommodate the probe. I was aware of\nmovement inside me. Not alarmed, not in pain, only aware. My stomach,\ndistended in odd ways, occupied my attention. I did not see. I knew what\nwas happening, what I had agreed to. I waited, patiently, comatose. They\nfound my insides to be positively normal.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Guts: “After the procedure in 2017,\n\n\nI prescribed you iron supplement pills.”\n\n\n“Yes,” I acquiesced, “they stopped working.”\n\n\n“They worked for a while,” she points out astutely.\n\n\nResearch has found that oral iron supplement treatments generally take\n6-8 months to fix the problem and restore the body’s iron levels. Two\nyears after the little red pills, my iron levels have generally remained\nquite low, my iron-deficiency anaemia without a clear fix. From April to\nMay 2019, I received iron intravenously.\n\n\nThat almost did the trick.\n\n\nSince the original procedure in 2017, I have twice received undiscussed\nand unexpected summons for another gastroscopy-endoscopy, in spite of my\ndoctor confirming that the original examination and accompanying\nbiopsies yielded no results. Part of me thinks Dr. Guts just really\nenjoys performing this particular test.\n\n\nUntil now, I have refused to undergo the procedure again. We’ve\ndiscussed other options, so I remain confused as to why that procedure\nwas requisitioned again. Yet here we are, December 2019, and tomorrow\nthey’re checking.\n\n\nI agreed to this. I’m afraid of the consequences of not following\nmedical orders. I spend a lot of my time concerned with the\npersonal/political consequences of ingesting such and such food or media\nproduct. I feel so porous, affected by everything I consume, medicine\nincluded. When it comes to medical orders, I follow them critically.\nThat is to say, I follow them. I do not presume to know how to balance\nmy body’s chemical load better than my MDs. I feel how the variety of\nmedications affect me, but currently lack knowledge about their\nbiological functioning or the targets we are trying to reach. Even\nthough I doubt anything will come\n\n\nfrom this test or the next, I agree.\n\n\nBecause I know this:\n\n\na normal amount of blood platelets is 150’000-300′000 per microliter of\nblood,\n\n\nand my counts in 2019, after 18 blood tests, have been between 9000 and\n427’000.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I do what I’m told, they stabilize;\n\n\nwhen I forget to take meds, omit to fill a prescription,\n\n\nor otherwise live life counter to medical recommendations,\n\n\nthey plummet.\n\n\n\n\nSo, each evening,\n\n\nI take a small orange pill marked 50mg,\n\n\nand a white one marked 25mg of the same.\n\n\n\n\nHaving chronic illness means giving up a degree of agency that many\npeople take for granted.\n\n\nI don’t have control over what doctors decide is necessary for my body.\n\n\nThat’s distressing, but I still have trust that the public-system\n\n\nspecialists who examine me have my Health (nebulous concept) in mind.\n\n\nThe same cannot be said for many other ways\n\n\nin which bodily autonomy is taken from individuals.\n\n\nThe medical violence I experience as a byproduct of treatment is of the\nsoftest sort.\n\n\nI’m working class, but I haven’t fallen through the cracks.\n\n\nI am, for all intents and purposes in the medical system, a man.\n\n\nI am not out there seeking hormone replacement therapy.\n\n\nAnd why not?\n\n\nI barely have the energy to make it through my weeks\n\n\nI am not about to compound that\n\n\nwith the social burden of coming out\n\n\nto everyone everywhere all the time.\n\n\nI don’t have the courage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Hyphema and Childhood Glaucoma\n\n\n\n\nI am\nlooking\nat a letter\nthat was faxed from my then-ophthalmologist\n\n(eye doctor) in Vancouver to my soon-ophthalmologist in Ottawa.\n\n\nRight before I was diagnosed with Immune Thrombocytopenia,\n\n\nI was playing by myself while I waited for Maman to finish\n\n\nmeeting with my Waldorf school kindergarten teacher.\n\n\nI had just been given back a toy that was confiscated\n\n\nand I was very excited to resume playing with it.\n\n\n\n\nAs fate would have it, the spinning toy turned on me\n\n\nand flew at my right eye, causing permanent damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a red day.\n\n\nRed as to stain my vision.\n\n\nRed with weep, sorrow.\n\n\nRed with pain, confusion.\n\n\nRed like the couches and the carpets\n\n\nin the first clinic my mother brought me to,\n\n\nthe one that started it all.\n\n\nRed that seeped into my right eye\n\n\nby a moment of inattention in the schoolyard,\n\n\nall thanks to the serrated plastic edge of a dragonfly.\n\n\nThat clinic referred us to British Columbia Children’s Hospital. It’s\nunnerving to think that without this injury,\n\n\nI might not have been brought to a clinic or hospital anytime soon, and\nwould have wandered the world of childhood, platelet-less, extremely\nvulnerable to any physical injury, with no one the wiser, and no\ndiagnosis. I’m grateful that my vulnerability made itself known through\nthis eye injury, rather than blunt force impact to something more vital.\nThe usual “bumps and bruises” of childhood.\n\n\nIn the subsequent months my eye bled into itself repeatedly, so I\neventually lost all “useful” vision.\n\n\n“Total hyphema” refers to complete filling of the eye’s front chamber\nwith blood.\n\n\n\n\nIn my case, this led to glaucoma and loss of sight.\n\n\nI don’t know when exactly it was that my right eye stopped Seeing.\n\n\nI don’t remember what it’s like to see out of both eyes.\n\n\nI don’t miss it. I may as well have been born like this,\n\n\nwere it not for notable intra-ocular pressure.\n\n\n\n\nIntraocular pressure (IOP) is the measure of pressure that has built up\nwithin a given eyeball.\n\n\nEye pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\n\n\nNormal eye pressure ranges from 12-22 mm Hg,\n\n\nand eye pressure of greater than 22 mm Hg is considered higher than\nnormal.\n\n\n\n\nAfter surgery, my doctor notes, my glaucoma-affected eye\n\n\nwas found to be at “a satisfactory 22 mm Hg.”\n\n\nExcellent, I adore being satisfactory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the doctors don’t mention amongst themselves\n\n\nis the impact of this intra-ocular pressure on basic quality of life.\n\n\nIOP causes pain, and when my right eye was in pain,\n\n\nthe signals interfered with the left, the “useful” eye.\n\n\nI couldn’t focus my sight on anything, concentrate,\n\n\nor, god forbid, hold sustained eye contact.\n\n\nI felt isolated and alone.\n\n\n\n\nITP meant I was barred from most forms of physical activity.\n\n\nIOP meant sleepless nights that bled into fuzzy days and years of ocular\nshut-in.\n\n\nAt school, sitting in a corner, book in hand, my glaucoma turned me into\na Curiosity.\n\n\n\n\nMy right eye developed a cloudy white-blue-green colour that I have\ngrown to love in my adult life. Not so, as a child. From the age of 5,\nwhen I “lost” my vision, until the age of 16 or so, when I had my last\neye surgery, my unseeing eye would regularly keep me up at night in\nagony until I passed out from exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was little, Maman and I had a routine:\n\n\nFirst, I would scream or whimper, sometime in the evening,\n\n\nusually around bedtime, when I was already tired\n\n\nand no longer had the capacity to ignore the discomfort.\n\n\nBeing tired always makes the eye act up, even to this day.\n\n\nSo, I would make known that I was in pain, one way or another,\n\n\nand try to smother it in a pillow or a series of cold-compresses.\n\n\nIOP pain feels like my eye is going to explode.\n\n\nIt felt like an ever-inflating ball inside my skull.\n\n\nI couldn’t see out of the offending eye,\n\n\nso where sight used to be there was only colourful pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI kind of understood what was going on,\n\n\nbut that was of little comfort in day-to-day life.\n\n\nChildren have no qualms about\n\n\npointing, staring, asking intrusive questions,\n\n\nventuring patchwork guesses about the nature of someone’s difference.\n\n\nI heard everything from\n\n\n“your eye grants you oracular powers” (which I like)\n\n\nto “your eye is that way because someone’s cum got stuck in it”\n\n\n(which fuelled mountains of internalized homophobia)\n\n\n\n\nKids say stupid things, nothing new here.\n\n\nStill, it’s important for me to acknowledge\n\n\nhow physical difference, especially visible difference from others,\n\n\ncan be deeply distressing as a child.\n\n\nMy visual impairment is a minor disability\n\n\nthat has not gotten in the way of most things I attempt to do in life.\n\n\nSelf-effacing caveat aside,\n\n\nhaving a single blind eye\n\n\nmade me a target\n\n\nof harassment\n\n\nand bullying\n\n\nfor years.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it took the form of a kid hiding around a corner,\n\n\nwaiting to jump-scare me on my blind side\n\n\nand then lording my inability to see over my head at any opportunity.\n\n\nSometimes there were snide comments.\n\n\nOftentimes there was no harm meant,\n\n\nbut I still felt myself ever more distant from my peers\n\n\nas a result of Seeing different and looking different.\n\n\n\n\nAnyone with eyes is likely to agree:\n\n\nan eye is a very sensitive, delicate ball of goop.\n\n\nJust as much as eyes are\n\n\nmuch-vaunted windows to the soul,\n\n\neyes are a means to an end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the contemporary north american city, image-saturated,\n\n\nsight is how I apprehend the world,\n\n\nit is what I was taught to focus on as the sense of Primary Importance.\n\n\nSeeing is primordial to Normal Existence,\n\n\nand eye-contact is how we first build empathy and human connection.\n\n\nI never regained that much lauded Useful Vision.\n\n\n\n\nBy medical standards, my sight is subpar,\n\n\nand my remaining eye must be protected\n\n\n(I tend to agree).\n\n\n\n\nInstead of useful vision my stunted optic nerve\n\n\nreacts to light and dark\n\n\npicks up on movement\n\n\nextends my spatial awareness\n\n\nin ways that differ from seeing.\n\n\n\n\nMy right eye won’t leave my “useful” left vision alone.\n\n\nIt gets in the way. In my living memory I have never seen double,\n\n\nbut my optic nerve has always kept providing me\n\n\nwith some kind of information.\n\n\nMy right eye does not see, but it feels.\n\n\nIt feels the wind on a cold winter day.\n\n\nIt feels the warmth of direct sunlight like exposed skin.\n\n\nMy occluded, not-useful ball of sense receptors\n\n\nhas maintained hyper-sensitivity to light.\n\n\nThe right eye feeds me never ending waves\n\n\nof colour and light patterns,\n\n\na world of my own\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDreamt\n\n\n\n\nCrystal clear deciduous dreams \n\nwhere a body uprooted taps\n\n\nback into the rhizome\n\n\nUp on the fronds new wings\n\n\ntake flight by attempting\n\n\nfirst to fall but find wind\n\n\nCaught in the bark a beetle\n\n\nnestles mandibles ever deeper\n\n\ntunnels and lays the grub\n\n\n\n\nHum along the chestnut cache\n\n\nburied where roots gape,\n\n\ndirt piles with the years.\n\n\nIt’s memory that’s held in the decay\n\n\nleaves nothing behind and unturned\n\n\nsleep remembers a simple moment\n\n\nMovement, the woodpecker’s red crest\n\n\nstaggers to its rhythm.

The doctors adopt a formal and clinical tone, getting right to\nthe facts of injury, illness, and treatment. My doctor knows his\nintended audience:\nOther Doctors.\nMD to MD.\nWhy, then, does each letter stress that I was such a nice boy? How is it\nmedically relevant to the treatment of my eyes and blood whether a boy\nor I’m nice? Getting gendered by medical authority carries weight.\nMedical sex, as well as gender presentation, seriously impacts how a\npatient is treated by their doctors.\nI have to wonder whether, on the flip side of the gender binary, Dr. C\nwould have referred to me as a nice girl, or added some kind of\ndiminutive? Nice Little Girl, for good measure? I can only speculate,\nbut it seems likely enough. The words we use have everything to do with\nour environment, and middle-aged men risk carrying subtle hints of\nmisogyny everywhere they go, including their medical practice.\nIn the treatment of ITP, I can understand how the possession of a uterus\nimpacts treatment after menstruation. What I’m struggling to wrap my\nhead around is why my eye-care specialist felt the need to specify, in\neach of his letters, that I was a Nice Boy. There’s an easy enough\nexplanation: in general, all children get gender assigned, in all walks\nof life, in a million contexts where it shouldn’t matter. This is just\none more example of that. Nothing new here. But I’m not satisfied by\nthat answer.\nMaybe the language is less stilted than the more clinical The Patient,\nbut it is ultimately less accurate to call me a boy than to call me a\npatient.\nIn operation reports, I am The Patient. The function of the documents is\nthe same, isn’t it? The letters and the reports? Both provide\ninformation about the status of me, Patient/Nice Boy, in order for other\ndoctors to know how things were going with my condition.\nThe major difference I can pin down stems from whether or not I was\nconscious during the time period referenced in the document. If I was\nawake, during a checkup, I was Matthieu-Xavier the Nice Boy. If I was\nunder anaesthetic, during surgery, I became The Patient.\nDuring routine checkups, I had a voice. I answered questions. Shared how\nI felt, whether I was in any pain. During surgery, I had no feeling,\nlost all subjectivity. I was asleep. The purpose of our interactions was\nfundamentally different. From Nice Boy to Patient all thanks to some\nanaesthetic.\nAt least Patient stands the test of time. I was only a boy because I’d\nbeen told my whole life that I was a boy and didn’t know I had the\noption to disagree, to dissent. I was a boy because terms of endearment\nlike “my little man” have been levelled at me forever. I was a boy\nbecause I got Jurassic Park toys and Hot Wheels and Beyblades and those\nare Boy Toys. I was a boy because I had scruffy short hair. I was a nice\nboy because I listened to the doctor.\nIs the use of Nice Boy a way to show empathy? To acknowledge that I am\nnot only a collection of symptoms, despite what the present letter would\notherwise have us believe? By acknowledging my niceness, my boyness, the\ndoctor may be saying:\n“This child has a life of some kind\noutside our scope of knowledge,\noutside of medicine.”\nTo deem me merely The Patient would have reduced my childhood to\nillness, pathology and nothing else.\nTo be a Nice Boy in my doctor’s letters means he was concerned with my\nwellbeing.\nI remember the ophthalmology wing at BC Children’s Hospital in 2001.\nThose appointments were separate from the ITP checkups. We walked back\nand forth from oncology. I was at the hospital almost daily that first\nyear.\nMy eye specialist, Dr. C., who wrote this letter, was a competent doctor\nand a kind man. Week after week I sat in his examination chair while he\nprodded my eyes with ophthalmic instruments and did what he could to\nsave my sight. He failed of course, but that was no fault of his. The\ncare proffered by the coalition of doctors and pharmaceutical\nconglomerates is a tendril of empire.\nThe doctors convene conferences on autoimmunity.\nI imagine they share stories of our bodies’\ndysfunctions over cocktails\nand look out at the Adriatic sea\nfrom the hotel bar in Athens.\nDoes the haematologist foot the bill himself,\nor does the institution?\nAre patients in attendance?\nPhysicians are on such a pedestal,\nall the better to market their expertise in private practice\nwith such snappy blog-posts as\n“14 ways to cure auto-immune disease”\nThe short of it? Consult with them for 350$/hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiving A Dose\n\n\n\n\nI’ve got a notion of time crawling\n\nbut the room stays the same.\n\n\nI patiently examine clocks distractions and infusion pumps\n\n\nas they move and mark different passings.\n\n\n\n\nI use the clock to remind myself clinical purgatory\n\n\nis impermanent and localized.\n\n\nWhile the body sits imbibing the fluid hung from stainless steel\n\n\nserved in pristine glass bottles and gently deflating plastic sacks.\n\n\n\n\nThe pump serves to regulate my donor-plasma-derived blood feast,\n\n\nmaking sure I don’t consume too much, too fast, too little, too slow.\n\n\nThe translucent saline drip opacifies the superstructures\n\ninherent to (con)temporary cure.\n\n\n\nObserving the drip, I easily forget that though the needles seem free,\n\n\nthis watery lifeblood implicates me in the systems I hate.\n\n\nA cannula is feeding me intravenous immunoglobulin and saline solution.\n\n\nIt was not the first time, it was not the last time.\n\n\n\n\nI am an expert at sitting in hospital chairs\n\n\nbut still have no feeling of power, for my many years of experience.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve accepted that my doctor knows what my body needs,\n\nif little else of the world.\n\nWorld which, outside these clinical walls,\n\nis rich with joy and sorrow.\n\nBut none of that matters now.\n\n\n\n\nNow, I am sitting in a blue chair among blue walls,\n\n\nbleeding red in purple veins while crystal clear\n\nplasma fractionations\nmake up the difference.\n\nGo on sitting, isn’t it comfortable?\n\n\nHave you ever tried a LUMEX? Best designed chairs around.\n\n\nSit for hours in total comfort.\n\n\nStandard issue LUMEX Clinical Care Recliner,\n\ndesigned for blood-work versatility.\n\nDrawing, letting, and transfusing are all viable activities.\n\n\n\n\nAs a child I was called a vampire, I embraced it.\n\n\nI figure a vampire is simply\n\n\none who requires liquid supplementation to survive;\n\n\none whose blood does not support them on its own;\n\n\none whose body is deeply vulnerable\n\nto specific circumstances.\n\n\n\nReceiving intravenous treatment implicates\n\n\nme in vampiric economic processes\n\n\nfacilitated by biotechnology.\n\n\nBlood feasts are involuntary, necessary.\n\n\nUnlike the mythical vampires,\n\n\nhaunting minds and prowling hunting grounds,\n\n\nmy offerings come to me, served up\n\nthrough hollow needles handled by steady hands.\n\n\n\nSoon afterwards, my body is mine again.\n\n\nMy vampirism is short-lived, if recurrent.\n\n\nIt leaves traces: needle marks, legal restrictions.\n\n\nMy lovers cannot donate blood; I am considered risky.\n\n\n\n\nCombining so many bodies in a transfusion leaves me\n\n\nbrimming with Otherness of the sort blood banks write off.\n\n\nAccording to those keepers of frozen life, my blood is impure,\n\n\nit is a poisonous potion that risks infecting others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo much of what I consume is involuntary.\n\n\nNauseous exhaust, pesticides, heavy metals, microplastics.\n\n\nI am needfully careful about what I do choose.\n\n\nA process of elimination, spiraling around a primary principle:\n\n\nchoose what comes from the nearest geographical place,\n\n\nand which has undergone the fewest transformations.\n\n\n\n\nNo coffee, no tea, no chocolate, no refined sugar.\n\n\nAlcohol depends on the season, and only ever as a food, not an\nintoxicant.\n\n\nCannabis depends on the season,\n\n\nand is best consumed mixed with other smoking herbs.\n\n\nSome sources of pleasure, introspection, and social joy.\n\n\n\n\nVitamins and supplements seem necessary\n\n\nonly because the food that is available for purchase is deficient\n\n\nin nearly all nutrients. There is a vicious cycle at work,\n\n\neducating bodies to consume synthetics\n\n\nrather than what comes from nature.\n\n\n\n\nPrescribed pharmaceuticals are useful, undeniably.\n\n\nUseful in mitigating symptoms in times of crisis.\n\n\nBut what happens upon habituation?\n\n\n\n\nA chronic treatment engenders chronic illness.\n\n\nIf a body is always consuming synthetic chemicals,\n\n\nit never learns to heal itself.\n\n\n\n\nTime does not stop, sat in the blue chair, but it does change.\n\n\nThe clock changes, bends to the body’s will.\n\n\nIt is the body that determines how long it will take\n\n\nto fully absorb the dose, how long I will be seated.\n\n\nDrain the sterile bag of its precious contents\n\n\nand claim them as part of myself.\n\n\nIt feels like I have no say, I am the witness.\n\n\nI observe the process and feel the newness within me.\n\n\nWhose body is it, anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-12 Adventures\n\n\n\n\nAll my body’s resources have been somehow drained.\n\nWe play catch-up every day of the week, friends.\n\n\nThe able-bodied can hardly conceive this sort of fatigue.\n\n\nThis is not just feeling tired.\n\n\nThis fatigue doesn’t care how many hours of sleep I got last night\n\n\nwhat I’ve eaten today, or for my intake of stimulants\n\n\nThis fatigue is the result of a hobbled immune system\n\n\nswinging its swords at the wrong targets.\n\n\n\n\nBacked into a corner by viral infection, it lashes out.\n\n\nNot quite at random, but with poor enough aim\n\n\nthat most of my platelets bite the dust at the same time.\n\n\nMy immune system feels like a dormant weapon of mass destruction.\n\n\n\n\nDays get long when your blood is unbalanced.\n\n\nI’ve been sitting in a chair all day and still managed a head-rush.\n\n\nI need to pack more snacks. Seems my anemia is bad these days.\n\n\nMy B12 must be at an all-time low,\n\n\nconsidering I’ve been prescribed a monthly shot.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve elected to give them to myself this time around.\n\n\nI do not have enough free time to go to the clinic for a shot every\nmonth\n\n\nwhen I have the option of doing it at home.\n\n\nI learned what to do through watching nurses, plus a youtube video.\n\n\nI’ve now administered myself the shot 3 times.\n\n\nThe first attempt was a misfire. I froze. I was scared.\n\n\nNever before had I held a thin metal-tipped\n\n\nplastic syringe in my own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I remember being a child playing in the bath\n\n\nWe kept some of the medical syringes used to dose oral drugs\n\n\nThey held a few milliliters of liquid\n\n\nI used them as water guns in my games.\n\n\n\n\nNow worries swim through my mind:\n\n\nWhat if I accidentally contaminated one of the elements of this\nprocedure?\n\n\nWill I inject myself with bacteria?\n\n\nWhat if I inject myself with air?\n\n\nThey say fresh air cures all\n\n\nbut I’m not sure that applies when taken intramuscularly.\n\n\n\n\nSo many needles in my life, always in other hands.\n\n\nSo, on the first attempt I scrapped the supplies.\n\n\nI made it all the way to the part where the syringe was primed with\nfluid,\n\n\nneedle in my arm, ready to deliver its payload.\n\n\nI took a few deep breaths, to no avail.\n\n\nI could not overcome my nerves on that first attempt.\n\n\n\n\nThe second time around was a success.\n\n\nI realized that with my scheduled flu shot coming up,\n\n\nit was imperative that the B12 be taken before the influenza,\n\n\notherwise I would not recuperate from the shot.\n\n\n\n\nThis was back in November, during college finals.\n\n\nSo on my way home from my job,\n\n\nI stopped at the pharmacy and purchased a new syringe\n\n\nPut 40 cents on my credit card\n\n\n\n\nI got home, and dropped the many\n\n\nearly-winter layers of protection I was wearing\n\n\nhaphazardly around my tiny apartment\n\n\nin my rush to get the shot over with.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I washed my hands, then I gathered up my supplies.\n\n\n1ml SANDOZ Vitamine B12 1000MCG/ML (DIN 00521515)\n\n\nwhich had cost me 8,37$\n\n\nand had not gone through on the RAMQ public insurance.\n\n\nNext, generic isopropyl alcohol sterilization pads,\n\n\nthe 1ml syringe, and a finger-shaped Band-Aid™ for afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nI chose the only part of me that has enough fatty tissue,\n\n\nin order to avoid injecting too deep, and prepared the injection site.\n\n\nAs I approached the needle, it brushed up against one of my fingers.\n\n\nThat was almost enough for me to call it off then and there.\n\n\nSelf-administered shots are nerve-wracking business.\n\n\nWhat if I had compromised the needle’s sterility\n\n\nand ended up with blood poisoning?\n\n\n\n\nI took a deep breath, and carried on.\n\n\nUltimately unfounded worries.\n\n\nBefore I knew it the needle had been inserted\n\n\nand the syringe plunger was waiting for its action.\n\n\n\n\nMore deep breathing.\n\n\nIn: ready yourself.\n\n\n\n\nOut: slowly contract your left hand’s thumb so as to inject the B12\nfluid.\n\n\nWatch it happen in the mirror, hardly feeling,\n\n\ncaught up in breathing, pushing away the fear.\n\n\nIn certain contexts the Bene Gesserit mantra rings true:\n\n\nFear is the mind killer.\n\n\nI feared that I was unable to safely take the necessary steps.\n\n\nI wanted to defer to a Professional. It boils down to this:\n\n\nI feared that I hadn’t the ability to take care of myself.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s always the fear when faced with a new challenge.\n\n\nWill I be able to do what is required in order to continue living?\n\n\nSo far the answer has always been yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Visit To The Blood Doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI saw my haematologist (blood specialist) recently.\n\nWell, first, I saw a Resident doctor under his tutelage.\n\n\nThis Resident had an air of confidence in her knowledge,\n\n\nseemed nervous holding down the clinic.\n\n\n\n\nAs I reported on my recent health and confirmed the information on file,\nshe took simple notes in neat handwriting. She then asked me to wait\nwhile she went to speak with my doctor. The young Resident returned with\nDr. O, a kindly middle-aged man with whom I have a good working\nrelationship.\n\n\nHe commented that I look well, to go along with my numbers, which have\nbeen positive as of late following a tumultuous year. We have the data\nto back this up: 18 recent blood tests. Not an an all-time yearly high\nfor me, but a respectable amount. Dr. O noted that my hair seemed\n\nespecially curly.\n\n“You’re always reinventing yourself.” he quipped.\n\n\n“Well, I’m young.” I replied.\n\n\nWe exchange some pleasant banter. I’m probably one of his younger\npatients. He’s been following my case since I was 19, and has seen me go\nthrough a number of phases and changes.\n\n\nWhen I first met Dr. O in 2015 I was hospitalized. I had recently moved\nto Montreal and didn’t have a specialist yet. It was my second semester\nof university, I had overworked myself and caught influenza. He got me\nsorted out.\n\n\n\n\nThat year, I was transfused a few rounds of Intravenous Immunoglobulin\n(IVIG), which got my platelets to shoot up briefly before plummeting\nagain. There’s a lot to be said about this drug, but that’s for later.\nFor now, suffice to mention that it’s a common treatment for ITP and\nother medical conditions.\n\n\nLater that same year, Dr. O got me on a more recent medication, which I\nstill take now (as of writing, in early 2020). Presently, I am\nprescribed 75mg of Revolade®, manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals\nCanada Inc. This medication’s active component is “eltrombopag”, which\nis a “thrombopoietin receptor agonist.”\n\n\nI have been taking this medication at varied dosages since mid-2015. Its\npurpose is to act as a productivity coach for my bone marrow, urging it\nto produce more blood platelets. The pills come in 25, 50, or 75mg\ncompositions of different colours.\n\n\nI speculate that the pills are different colours because it makes them\neasily identifiable on the factory floor, so that a 50mg pill has a\nrather slim chance of finding itself in a packet of 25mg pills.\n\n\nIn fact, I have never seen such a mixup, so I suppose their system is\nworking. No, mixups in dosage have always come from human error on my\nend. I’m pretty good about remembering to take my meds now. It’s baked\ninto my daily routine, but sometimes I’ll forget.\n\n\n\nSkeletal formula of eltrombopag olamine,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll be out of the house with plans to\n\n\nstay elsewhere overnight, and didn’t bring my pills.\n\n\nOr I waited too long before calling the pharmacy\n\n\nto renew, so I’ve got none left,\n\n\nand it’s Saturday right now,\n\n\nand the pharmacy doesn’t get any deliveries on Sunday,\n\n\nso they won’t have my Revolade until Monday\n\n\nbecause it’s a special order.\n\n\nIn 5 years, they’ve never just happened to already have it in stock.\n\n\nAgain, I’m not certain why that is, but can venture a guess\n\n\nthat I’m one of very few, if not the only person\n\n\naround here who’s got it prescribed.\n\n\nThere’s also the matter of cost,\n\n\nwithout the RAMQ\n\n\nor private insurance\n\n\nfooting the bill.\n\n\nAbout 4500$ per 28 days’ supply.\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, a yearly bureaucratic process grants me access with minimal\nmonetary expense. If Revolade were not currently my only viable option,\nI would not be on this drug. Its side-effects &amp; precautions sheet,\nincluded in every box, is the size of a poster, with one side in english\nand the other in french. Some potential side-effects include: cataracts.\nI can’t wrap my head around that one. The prospect of developing\ncataracts, the implication of going “totally blind”, at the age of\n20-something, is not appealing. In practice, that’s not remotely likely\nto happen, so I keep taking the drug.\n\n\n\n\nBut it’s a stroke of luck that I’m fluently bilingual\n\n\nso that I can get anxious in two languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming Sick, Becoming Trans\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I showed a friend some of these writings early on, they said:\n\n\nPicturing you as a protagonist on some wild life ride helps me digest\nthe fact that everything you’re experiencing is real and at times\nscary. I think I would worry far too much otherwise. I hope your\nnewsletter allows you to experience some form of escapism, if only for\na few fleeting moments. How could you not, with all that imagery?\n\n\nI replied:\n\n\nDear Friend, this is not for me a form of escapism.\n\n\nLately, I’ve been experiencing feelings that I don’t yet have the right\nlanguage to describe. Some of what I feel is vigour, passion, lust,\nsorrow, loss. My body feels sore but good, which is an unusual\ncombination for me. I feel connected to the world yet distant. Perhaps\nmost importantly, I feel angrythat the world is so many of the ways that\nit is right now. I feel possessed by rage, which, I’m beginning to\nrealize is at the root of how I choose to be in the world.\n\n\nI feel as though the quote-unquote “sickness” that has shaped my life is\nlittle more than a cultural fiction. I do not mean narrative fiction\nwith political themes. Someone reading a novel or a story can close the\nbook and leave the realm of fiction behind. There is an important\ndifference between cultural fiction and narrative fiction.\n\n\n\n\nCultural fiction is the realm of lived experience formed by all our\nreceived notions of what is and is not possible in reality. It feels as\nthough the words I’ve used to describe myself over the course of my life\nare becoming increasingly senseless. Cultural fiction is the language I\nlearned to use to identify myself with people, groups, categories. Name,\nsex, gender, political status.\n\n\n“How about we all go around and introduce ourselves?\n\n\nLet’s do names, pronouns,\n\n\nand anything else you feel like sharing.”\n\n\nAll of these words are useful short-hand for use on official documents.\nFor many people whose legal identity markers differ in ways from mine,\nthese words are necessary for survival, for recognition and access to\nessential community and services. These Words are not identity. I\nbelieve there is no essential identity, only a shifting set of\nrelations, many of which determine social-political status. I use words\nregularly in order to access medication, credit, lodging; they remain\npolitical fictions. The same system which designates me as Male leads to\nmy diagnosis as Chronically Ill, a nice boy. Politically, I am my\n“deficient” immune system as much as I am a male of legal voting age. In\nactuality, I am not Matthieu-Xavier Marin, though that is the name that\nappears on my passport. I echo here Paul B. Preciado’s words:\n\n\nI am not a man and I am not a woman and I am not heterosexual I am not\nhomosexual I am not bisexual. I am a dissident of the sex-gender system.\nI am the multiplicity of the cosmos trapped in a binary political and\nepistemological system.\n\n\nFor me, being trans is being sick and being sick is being trans. I do\nnot seek medical/legal transition. My gender (or lack thereof) and my\npolitical identity are as real as my illness. My body is already the\nproduct of modern medicine, official Womanhood does not call out to me.\nMy body has been the blood of unknown thousands worldwide, it was the\nPenicillin I took for over a decade, and is the anti-haemorrhage pills I\ntake every day now. I do not want or need synthetic estrogen to cease\nbeing Male, I have long since been in transition. My body has been in\nrevolt against the sex-gender system from the moment my immune system\nwent haywire and began attacking its host: Me.\n\n\n\n\nThe moment a twist of fate blinded one of my eyes I was no longer the\nMale fiction which was assigned to me at birth, I was (and am) A\nPatient. And now, I am learning how to cope with the dis-identification\nfrom masculinity, sickness, and health. There is no escaping these\nfictions which shape my body and yours. Every time I go to a clinic I\nreaffirm the fiction that is Matthieu-Xavier Marin, the fiction of\nmasculinity, the fiction of Immune Thrombocytopenia, all in order to\nreceive treatment which increases my quality of life.\n\n\nWhen the power to withhold treatment may be so quickly brandished, I act\ncounter to my beliefs. If medicine could treat bodies without gendering\nthem, if it were possible to be considered a sovereign political subject\nwithout necessarily being M or F, millions of people would not share my\nproblem. In the current binary system, it is not possible. Honestly, not\nundergoing Official Transition is a form of harm reduction, of not\nmaking more friction for myself.\n\n\nIn naming these things as fiction, I do not deny their material reality.\nBut new fictions must be invented in order to account for the\nmultiplicity of experience.\n\n\nI write it in order to speak. I am writing to engage in dialogue. I am\nwriting with others to redefine what is possible, in order to bring new\nversions of myself into existence. This is an enactment of who I am in\nthe world. It is my way of playing with language until I can find out\nhow to describe and share what my reality consists of. I am speaking the\ndeath of my sick human body, and of the fictions which have shaped my\nworlds, in all the complexity that entails. All this, in order to better\nimagine new possibilities for existing with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotophobia and Blind Gain\n\n\n\n\nTranscription of doctor’s letter, 2001:\nDear Dr. B, RE:M-X MARIN.\n\nFurther to my previous letter regarding this nice little boy, we have\ncontinued to follow him up on a weekly basis. Matthew has becomes very\nlight shy. His examination is quite difficult as a result. Slit lamp\nexamination on the right shows profound corneal staining which has\nworsened since he had a further bleed inside the right eye. On the\nleft sight, the slit lamp examination is difficult.\nNevertheless, I was able to obtain a good view of his cornea, anterior\nchamber, iris, lens and anterior vitreous. There is no suggestion of\nocular inflammation whatsoever. His corneal surface is intact and\nthere is no conjunctival inflammation either. I cannot account for\nMatthew’s symptoms of photophobia. I do not think this is evidence of\nsympathetic ophthalmia. There is a potential risk of this in view of\nhis past history. I have suggested that he continue to use the topical\nVoltaren and Prednisolone 1% drops previously prescribed to the right\neye and that he re-attend in three weeks. I would like to see him\nsooner if his symptomatology worsens.\nKindest regards.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Wikipedia community editors, Photophobia is an abnormal\nintolerance to visual perception of light. It is an experience of\ndiscomfort or pain to the eyes due to light exposure or physical\nsensitivity. When my eye doctor diagnosed my photophobia, they were\nbasing themselves on how I reacted to the bright directional lights used\nfor examination.\n\n\nThe word photophobia can also mean morbid fear of cameras or seeing.\n\n\nIt is aversion, an impulse to recoil from looking.\n\n\nIn my regular life, photophobic days are when I won’t make eye contact,\nleaving the house is less likely to happen, and I can’t concentrate on\nanything.\n\n\nPhotophobia is not unlike a migraine. It’s kinda like seeing multicolour\nTV static on those old bunny-ear sets. Over the years, I had a few eye\nsurgeries to diminish eye-ball pressure. Back when the pressure was\nextremely high, I’d have photophobic days a lot. Lately it’s uncommon.\n\n\nThe only cause I’ve been able to pinpoint for photophobia in my adult\nlife is fatigue. When I am tired, my eyes hurt. A straightforward\nformula. Following months working full-time at a computer, my tolerance\nto screens has diminished significantly, so I rarely watch TV anymore.\n\n\nWhen my eyes are in pain, I use them differently. I’m not equipped for\nnavigating life without sight, I lack practice. Still, my eyes ask that\nI take a break from staring into the world, and learn other ways of\nunderstanding.\n\n\nHow about another reading of photophobia: not as pathological aversion\nto sight, but as revolt against vision by Blindness, as “blind gain.” I\nam inspired by the d/Deaf studies narration of deaf gain rather than\nhearing loss. Deafness and Blindness have been thought of as framing\nexperience. Okay. Whose frame? Who’s doing this framing?\n\n\nFraming is a partial, banal, and unimaginative metaphor about sight. It\nrestricts possibilities outside of “useful vision” by constructing\nborders around possibilities for constellation. “Looking” appears as\njust a tool for knowledge. Unfortunately, this tool is weaponized.\n\n\nSight is a basis of pathology: it creates normality, symptoms.\n\n\nSight bores into reality, to prove it can be seen.\n\n\nVision is a scope for framing reality in your sights, making reality a\nvisible entity open to calculation and marketing. I’m so tired of being\nmarketed at. Vision is predatory, capturing images for language to\nnarrow down by force. Looking has been used to choose the visible and\nconstruct the invisible. It is mobilized to create fear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore one surgery a nurse applied anesthetic goop\n\n\nto your left hand where the IV would go later.\n\n\nI didn’t protest but soon after the solution began acting upon the\nnerves\n\n\nI realized your hand was on its way to disappearing.\n\n\nI had learned not to trust your eyes\n\n\neven as they assured us the hand remained visible.\n\n\n\n\nLooking is a trap. Looking occurs from the outside in.\n\n\nPeering upon the surface of skin of paper of the fire\n\n\nwe see only the surface the folds of visible material.\n\n\nGazing at you is accompanied by the inner sense\n\n\nof flow of blood of breath the pulse if our attention is tuned.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the obsession with microscopy?\n\n\nTired extension of the eye’s desire to sense\n\n\nsurfaces across new territories.\n\n\nHolders of a pair of human eyes cannot\n\n\nthen be content with the sight\n\n\nproffered by you my darling the mostly sighted?\n\n\n\n\nFor years we glued your eye to a viewfinder\n\n\nin the hopes of discovering a new way to capture light.\n\n\nToo late, far too late. The image catalog is overflowing as it is.\n\n\nOkay, we said, and turned the camera on ourself,\n\n\non you, to reshape and mold in static frames what motion only confused.\n\n\nDay and night rearranging that bedroom above Boul. St-Jo\n\n\nto catch the sunlight the lamplight against the blank walls,\n\n\ndreaming of a “real” studio, hardly realizing that\n\n\nspace is not what makes the photograph but indeed it is the eye.\n\n\nFriends asked how I do it and I quipped\n\n\nthat your singular sight holds many secrets.\n\n\nThat’s still true, but photography with its focus on the visible\n\n\ncannot capture the ocular sublime of your optic nerves.\n\n\n\n\nPhotos serve to explore you\n\n\nto find other angles the mirror doesn’t allow,\n\n\nto rip out your eye and relocate it\n\n\n6 feet away where the machine holds the key\n\n\nto new territories of fleshy surfaces\n\n\nenfolded as we find more positions to reveal you\n\n\nand put you on display, on a pedestal of our choosing.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s understand symptoms of vision loss as blind gain,\n\n\nin a conscious shift away from the regime of vision.\n\n\nBlind gain is looking’s move beyond instrumental sight.\n\n\nBlind gain surpasses sight in order to reveal\n\n\nan invisible present within the ongoing moment.\n\n\nBlind gain is the feeling that we have much to learn from sightlessness.\n\n\n\n\nIt is a sensitivity to the harms enacted by vision.\n\n\nIt is a category for imagining beyond sight.\n\n\nIt is an awareness that a shift in perception is a good thing.\n\n\nMy blindness is always changing.\n\n\n\n\nHow come I was told all my life that I had lost vision,\n\nrather than gained blindness?\n\nSome summer days, my blind eye can take the full brunt of the sun.\n\n\nOther days, a dim room or my phone’s screen\n\n\nare enough to force both my eyes closed in defence against the light,\n\n\nso vision can’t really look at anything either.\n\n\nThese are those photophobic days, when blindness revolts.\n\n\nBlind gain creates interference.\n\n\nThe pictures might come through, or not.\n\n\nKnowledge is open to all, and images are not life.\n\n\nTo feel deeply, we must think beyond the visible.\n\n\nThe sensation of flows in my body is enough proof that I am still alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am troubled by our senses, and sight’s legacy within feeling.\n\n\nWe tend to impose perception rather than feel with honesty.\n\n\n“Framing” so much as the birds we may hear or the earth we lay on.\n\n\nVerily, enframing is sight’s doing, vision’s call to arms.\n\n\nFraming restricts fields of experience, like we have long penned\nanimals:\n\n\nto keep them in sight, under relative control.\n\n\nFrames are borders: geometric and geographic,\n\nimposed by the Eye’s vision.\n\nFraming establishes a relationship of domination\n\nbetween parties meeting upon the field.\n\nGiven that sight is essentially limited, it seeks unseen territories\n\n\nin order to deepen, widen, and stratify its expanse.\n\n\n\n\nSight is a tool, wielded by Power, so that previously-unseen\n\n\nothers may be ensnared and dispossessed by its frames.\n\n\nSight is a barometer of what is allowed within or without,\n\n\nas human or other, white or other,\n\n\nman or other, straight or other, living or dead.\n\n\nSight lacks nuance, even in its waning imperial rule.\n\n\nSight is the trouble we stay with even while learning about\nalternatives.\n\n\nWe’re stuck with it, as seers or seen and often as both. \n\n\n\n\nTransgressive is any act which would break down the frames\n\n\nand create unseen realms of possibility.\n\n\n\n\nBlind gain is an unframing, an unseeing, a re-realizing without borders,\n\n\nwhere we may share with each other what we know and\n\n\nwhat we might use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSickness As A Way Of Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020-04-01\n\n\n\n\nSickness involves learning how the body is remedied and poisoned.\n\nWhen sickness and medicine come together, they create illness. Living\nwell with an ever-present awareness that sickness exists is a learned\npractice. I learned as I grew up in-and-out of hospitals.\n\n\nI am reading The Immune System, A Very Short Introduction, because I do\nnot understand how how the body’s biology works. I’m finding this\nIntroduction scientifically informative, but I’ve got a bone to pick\nwith its language.\n\n\nAs an example, the book’s metaphor for viral infection is of “hijacking”\ncells. To me, that language implies that our cells are private property\nbeing commandeered by a virus and driven off course towards doom. This\nrhetoric of the body seems to make our own bodies unworthy of trust.\nThey must be controlled, bridled like wild horses.\n\n\nDifferent bodies have different claims to ownership, and enact varying\ndegrees of violent repression\n\n\nto maintain ownership over the cells of other bodies. For a Citizen in\n21st century so-called-canada, which I am, the ownership-bid is divided\nup in as many parts as there are calls for us to work productively, or\nencouragements to consume “freely” the fruits of global economic\nproduction shipped to our northern land. This is a soft repression.\n\n\nIn Illness as Metaphor, Susan Sontag dissects the literature concerning\nTuberculosis and Cancer. Pervasive disease of the 18-20th centuries. She\nfinds that a recurring metaphor for Turberculosis is “consumption.”\nConsumption is defined here as a manner of appearing ill. It was\nenvisioned glamorously. Many aristocrats adorned themselves\n“consumptively.” Tuberculosis was fashionable.\n\n\n\n\nFor others in Sontag’s analysis, consumption was viewed as a habit to be\nbroken. In other words: the malady of Tuberculosis itself was a habit.\nIn all cases, Sontag’s metaphors of illness seem concerned with the\nperception of illness in others, with its representation after the fact,\nnot with the lived reality of sickness.\n\n\nSontag herself had 3 cancers, and died with the third. She never\npublished auto-biographical texts in her life. But I took a detour to\nread her early journals, 1947-1963. Poor Susan had no grasp on her\nemotions. She is ruled by them even as she parses out the intellectual\nintricacies of life. These journals take us from ages 16-30 or so. From\nauditing classes at Berkeley, through marriage, early years of her child\nDavid, bohemia in Paris, and life as a young writer in NYC. She’s\nstruggling throughout with How to Love, Be a Jew, Be a Writer. She reads\nwidely and ceaselessly. Voraciously considers her culture, lives it. All\nthe while, the journals are precipitously self-conscious. “How do I\nexist?” A perpetual reflexive self-analysis. Relentless. Sontag never\nonce relaxed in all these 15 years. Her love affairs all strike me as\nchildish. Why? She is entrapped, stuck in co-dependency. She admits in\nthe 60s that she feels rarely able to be alone, that she feels\nun-self-sufficient. She vampirized her lovers. No doubt some of that was\nmutual, but as a reader I saw only S.S’ view. As a reader indeed, the\nexperience was thrilling. The sheer intimacy of it. I dreamt of her last\nnight.\n\n\nSomehow, the ill are read as on their way to death’s door. Sontag’s book\nwas reviewed as an exhilarating “literary” performance, in spite of her\nexplicit point that “illness” is not a metaphor. She was wrong. Susan\nwould have us regard illness in a “healthy” way “purified” of metaphoric\nthinking. Simultaneously, she enforces borders between “Kingdoms of\nhealth and ill.” It seems that, to Sontag, illness broke life into a\nbinary Good and Bad. 40 years later, those alleged borders are radically\nporous. Each of us harbours a near-constant awareness that at any moment\nwe may fall ill and be rendered dependent on others for our ability to\nconsume. Sickness demands that we trust the people around us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean, to trust?\n\n\nHow can we trust our own bodies,\n\n\nlet alone others,\n\n\nwhen a virus is pandemic?\n\n\nHow could we possibly trust,\n\n\nwhen we understand viral infection as an attack,\n\n\na virus as a combatant?\n\n\nWhen we’re always on the defence, shields raised?\n\n\nInstead of virus as hijacker, what about the virus as teacher?\n\n\nFrom a virus, a host body learns to develop anti-bodies with which to\neliminate the infection.\n\n\n\n\nHow many of us now are now unsure what to do with our days,\n\n\nwhen we can hardly produce or consume?\n\n\nHow many of us feel guilty?\n\n\nThis moment is an opportunity to learn other ways\n\n\nof using time and resources.\n\n\nHow many of us are afraid?\n\n\nHow can we defend ourselves against the metaphors of illness and viral\ninfection at once?\n\n\nIllness is an idea, and it is shaped by how we invoke the word.\n\n\nIllness is the stress, fear, restlessness, guilt, and unease we are\nfeeling.\n\n\nIllness is why many of us don’t know what to make of their days.\n\n\n\n\nSickness as a way of life is an ecology of presence,\n\n\nan acceptance of the covenant between our bodies and the earth.\n\n\nWe alive now are not any more guilty for pandemic than climate change,\n\n\nbut we must be responsible for how we respond to both and more.\n\n\n\n\nPopulations have been violently dispossessed of responsibility by the\ndominant order of things,\n\n\nand we are at grips to reclaim our presence on the living earth we\ninhabit.\n\n\nPandemic may serve as disillusionment within apocalypse.\n\n\nWe are here. Not morally or legally bound to responsibility,\n\n\nbut filled with desire to promote renewal, reciprocity, and respect.\n\n\nThis moment is so full of embodied potentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime flows by. Saturdays, I am not turning on my phone or computer.\n\n\nHow much physical isolation is by design? How are ‘safety’ and\n‘productivity’ linked?\n\n\nPandemic is globally a herald for martial law. Public safety restricts\ninterpersonal contact to forms dictated by law so that ‘unsafe’ actions\nmay be limited. Organizing mass physical protest seems unthinkable when\npandemic is rampant. The imposition of public safety over history has\nforced acts of public revolt to assume non-violent forms. “Peaceful\nprotest.” With increased surveillance came increased reliance on\nsubterfuge. There was a move away from violent uprising toward\nideological battle. Peoples were dispossessed of arms so that power may\nkeep them. The disarmament of society and the militarization of policing\nco-operate with the word of law to ensure “safety.”\n\n\nWe rely on ideas to keep us safe rather than the bodies we inhabit, so\nwe have no more arms with which to care for ourselves. How can we take\nresponsibility if no one has taught us how? It is a matter of learning\nhow to be sick.\n\n\n\n\nSickness is a call to collective action.\n\n\nSickness is what families, communities, and affinity groups come\ntogether to care for.\n\n\nSickness is a way of life.\n\n\nIllness is sickness’ ethic reduced to a pathology.\n\n\nIllness is a means to shrug off personal responsibility.\n\n\n\n\nIt removes us from the lived reality of sickness all around.\n\n\nMy sickness is real enough.\n\n\nReal, in that doctors have a name for it.\n\n\nA set of treatments. An agreed-upon scale of severity.\n\n\nReal in fact because it is named, and quantifiable.\n\n\nLittle guesswork remains, there are the facts, the diagnosis.\n\n\nIllness, still, is obscene.\n\n\n\n\nIn conversation, I notice people seem afraid to utter the word pandemic.\n\n\nA rock-star academic already has a book about COVID-19 available for\npre-order.\n\n\n\n\nI feel like a teenager, back when everything was “so sick”,\n\n\neven while illness had long enveloped the entirety of my waking life.\n\n\n\n\nEvery day, I question: what is worth doing right now?\n\n\nCurrently Reading, Writing, Talking, Walking, Dancing,\n\n\nCycling, Tai chi, Qi-Gong, Meditating, Cooking, Sleeping,\n\n\nPlaying and Watching by myself and with myself, Photography\n\n\nare all worth doing for me.\n\n\n\n\nI have learned that an excess of self-discipline is no substitute for\nspontaneity and joy,\n\n\nso I smoke cannabis because it helps me feel better and more\ncontemplative.\n\n\n\n\nI live alone with support, and I am screen-averse.\n\n\nThis is a difficult combination right now,\n\n\nwhen a breach in loneliness comes mostly through the internet.\n\n\nI have felt guilty for my own improved well-being amidst pandemic.\n\n\nHow is it that I should feel in may ways\n\n\nbetter than two weeks ago?\n\n\nSo many others are suffering right now.\n\n\nYet I have more energy, more willpower,\n\n\nand a renewed sense of purpose.\n\n\nDaily my desire to create grows.\n\n\nI feel more present in the world now than I ever have.\n\n\n\n\nThe apartment I rent houses me alone.\n\n\nI do not wake up or sleep near others right now.\n\n\nMy days are mostly devoted to contemplation.\n\n\nI am supported in making sure my material needs are met.\n\n\nFor me, the radical slow-down of daily life\n\n\nhas been a deeply positive thing.\n\n\nMy awareness of current-global-events has narrowed.\n\n\nI only really follow certain local developments.\n\n\nI know the rest of the news-cycle exists too,\n\n\nbut since I don’t seek it out,\n\n\nit rarely comes to me by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying around my home and limiting commercial contact\n\n\nhas allowed me to devote far more time to resting.\n\n\n\n\nDoesn’t anyone else find Rest difficult to come by when daily routine\ninvolves commuting and working among hundreds and thousands of others?\nThe press of city life is exhausting and driven by an excess of\naccumulation and commerce.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s honestly far more pleasant to stay home.\n\n\nHere, I feel control over the ideas that direct my life.\n\n\nI can unplug my clock, and suddenly time is radically changed for me.\n\n\nThe mot-d’ordre ceases to be.\n\n\nI’m suddenly aware my rhythm is in tune with the rising and setting sun,\n\n\nrather than the numbers on the dial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Matter\n\n\n2020-04-08\n\n\n\n\nI live for myself. How could it be any other way?\n\nI am selfish. I acknowledge that within my own life, my wellbeing comes\nfirst. It is by keeping myself alive that I can best support others.\nThose I love, who turn to me for support, I want to be there for them.\nIf I do not do what I must in order to feel good and whole within\nmyself, I cannot sustainably support others. Our lives, intertwined, I\ndo not wish them extirpated, no matter what the government regulations\nstipulate. I want to enmesh us further, to know what comes of closeness.\nTo do this, we must learn when to say ‘No. Enough. Not right now.’\n\n\nThis is not up to authority to determine, it is individual\nresponsibility. So long as I am able, I will turn this ability into\ngood. I am no better or worse than anyone else. Each of us is here, and\nlearning what that means. How can anyone possibly presume to know what’s\nbest for another person? We all have different answers. I tend my own\ngarden and share the harvest. I strive to glean carefully what each\nworld-fragment has to share. To recognize and shed prejudice, gather\neach thing on its own as a whole part of the larger universe.\n\n\nDaily I take stock of my capacity. Variability and fluctuation unlike\never before. Or perhaps I’m just more perceptive. I’ve been in a more\npersonally tumultuous state before. Now, the tumult is outside. My inner\nlife is relatively calm. I notice its intricacies in more detail, it is\nwith both apprehension and excitement that I write down my dreams. I aim\nto Stop expecting a text back. Stop demanding a response. Each of us is\noverwhelmed by demands on our attention. Forget any notion that you are\nmore important than any one else. I am not any more important than\nanyone else, don’t get back to me if you don’t have the energy, and\nplease do not feel guilty. Everyone on earth, without exception, is part\nof what is underway ever after this state of limbo.\n\n\n\n\nShare what matters to you, far and wide, regardless of expectation. Make\nno demands on the energy of others unbidden, but do not be afraid to\nshare. What is it that is keeping you going right now? No matter how\nbenign, someone else empathizes. Our ideas must flow with compassion. We\nfeel the way together.\n\n\nHow do I feel? I feel my feet cocooned in thin socks, intimately\nfamiliar with the old wood floor. I know the floor’s dips and inclines,\nfor having stood alone with it. I feel my window facing 120 degrees SE,\nif my dusty old compass is to be believed. I feel the sun’s rays rising\nthrough the southeasterly portal. I’ve cracked it open, so I’m stroked\nby spring breeze and I hear spring sound. I feel excitement and\ndetermination, as I focus on my projects.\n\n\nI feel the air I breathe, and I feel the tightness of anxiety in my\nlungs.\n\n\nI feel both my eyes distinct from one another.\n\n\nI feel the nerves sprouting from the skull’s base, connecting me.\n\n\nI see the sun on my skin and sense pleasant warmth.\n\n\nI bear a light ache in my heart as sad thoughts of distant separation\ncome to mind.\n\n\nI pause, and read a paragraph from Phèdre aloud to myself.\n\n\nUnable to digest more than that at once, I lay the book back down on my\ndesk.\n\n\nPlato’s Socrates is opposed to allegorical interpretation of the world.\n\n\nFollowing the Oracle at Delphi’s guidance, he chooses to focus on\nlearning himself.\n\n\n\n\nAnd who do I presume to be? One whose voice rings clear within the\ndepths of my own flesh. A body is anything but transparent, I contain\nfar more than the sum of my parts. Each action I take for my own\nwellbeing drives me forward toward a higher version of myself.\nCompleting even the most benign tasks is part of the puzzle. Self-care\nis primordial. I love this world. I love existing with/in it. I love its\nsimplicity and complexities. The wellspring of sensation runs deeper\nthan I can ever know. All my efforts to feel deeply spiral together,\nsharper and deeper, plunging my body into itself. I leave aside\npreconceptions about what it is possible for me to feel, and take\nnew/familiar sensations as they come, not disbelieving my own grasp of\nreality. Why should I ever tell myself a feeling is false? I am blessed\nwith an honest body, one which attempts no trickery. It is with time and\npatience that I learn the grammar of sensation. There is no formula for\nlove, there is only acknowledgement of its possibility and dedication to\nits practice. Love is a choice.\n\n\nInner life is inherently true, there is no contradicting solipsistic\nexperience. Inner life risks becoming false when it butts up against the\nouter world and its many contradictions, yet the truth of inner life\ndoes not make it serene. Truth can be chaos, hurt, confusion. It is\nthrough acceptance that I begin to make sense of my truth. Facing\nunpleasant truth is difficult. It’s much simpler to focus only on\npositives, to live as though everything ought to be pleasurable all the\ntime. Even now, there are so many positives.\n\n\nFocusing on pain is a necessary means of better understanding my place\nin the world, my relationship to my past, my needs in the present, and\nmy desire for a future. Not those material wants which lend themselves\nto a certain lifestyle, but the needs of which drive me.\n\n\nSo many questions from disparate sources with ongoing answers: What is\nthe capacity for violence? What do we harness, to grow in power? Who are\nwe? How can we be meaningfully frightened? What happens when the\ntemporarily-able-bodied, the not-ill, begin to roam again? What is the\nvalue of escape in living with presence? How do we balance Here+Now with\nThen+There in order to survive pandemic’s emotional toll? What is it\nabout stories of unreal proportions that feel so liberating?\n\n\n\n\nStorytelling is freedom-making. The reading of stories is a cure for\nloneliness and it is an amnesiac. Reading is a matter of embodying the\nreality suggested in the text. There is a great beauty in this temporary\ncommandeering of memory. Give up on courage, and escape. How wonderful,\nthat I might ignore human suffering for a time, and empathize with\nnarrative fiction instead. Draped in its own fictions, waking life hurts\nme to bear. So much is wrong and so much is uncertain. In re-reading a\nfamiliar story, I can suspend my knowledge of how much I do not know\nhere and now, to indulge in knowing some future, and strap into the\ntumult leading up to an ending.\n\n\nFor there is an end, even to 3000 page sagas. The printed page is\nfloriously static. It does not risk slipping into new terrifying realms\nof as-yet-unimagined unknowns. I have picked a narrative I know, I am\nfamiliar with the arc upon which I will fly. And there, escaping into\nother identities, I find comfort.\n\n\nThere is no going back to normal.\n\n\nNormal?\n\n\nNormal as in healthy?\n\n\nThere can be no going back because what pandemic reveals is the fiction\nof health. We have never been healthy. Health is a story woven by\ninstitutional power in order to create a reality in which it is possible\nto negate certain lives on the basis of abnormality or pathology.\n\n\nPandemic extends the logic of medicalization to everyone. Prevention is\ncurrently the treatment preached by the government of canada, so that we\nmay slow the spread of COVID-19 and not overwhelm our public healthcare\ninfrastructure. The infrastructure relies on previous expectations of\nhow many might fall ill at a given time, and the built environment\nreflects that calculus. The status of illness in society is undergoing\nradical change, as we all now may be sick.

Positive Reinforcement.\n\n\nDoctor’s Orders Better Safe Than Sorry.\n\n\nDespite the antibiotics, we regularly rushed\n\n\nto the hospital in the middle of the night.\n\n\nThe problem with not having a spleen\n\n\nis the speed at which an infection might turn deadly.\n\n\nThat’s why, when I have a fever of 38.5C I go to the ER.\n\n\nUsually it’s just the flu.\n\n\nWhen my immune system starts doing its job\n\n\n— eliminating infection —\n\n\nit also remembers just how much\n\n\nit despises my blood platelets.\n\n\nThe result is that any infection\n\n\nleaves me with dangerously low platelet counts,\n\n\nsometimes in the range of\n\n\n“may spontaneously bleed internally.”\n\n\nI am not afforded the possibility of waiting it out\n\n\nand seeing whether my condition improves on its own.\n\n\nYeah odds are it’s fine i’ll just sleep it off\n\n\nbut what if it isn’t?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1N1, 2009\n\n\nI didn’t get the vaccine\n\n\nand wasn’t alive for the 1918 outbreak.\n\n\nNo antibodies, so I catch swine flu late June.\n\n\n40C fever near delirious in Ottawa children’s hospital bed,\n\n\nI remember my friends were on a school trip to Toronto\n\n\nstrapped in to roller-coasters at an amusement park to experience\nexcessive g-force.\n\n\nI may have played video games, I’m not sure, I don’t remember.\n\n\nI created my first Runescace account in 2006, I was 10 years old. I’d\nplay in the couple hours waiting for test results before the doctor’s\nvisit. I think I found it because it was popular on Miniclip. The\nsoundtrack, the world, the slow pace; Runescape is a waiting game. I\nremember discovering my player character’s limits heading West, followed\nby an in-game pal. “Where are we going?” “To find the elves.” —only,\nthe elves are pay-walled. Eventually, I convinced Maman to pay my\nmembership fee, but I never progressed through to the elven settlement.\nA simple structure: Quests, levels, trading, combat. Goals to reach.\nPower to gain. Every attainment felt hard-earned in its reward. The\ncommunity, active and friendly back then, seemed to be composed mostly\nof other kids around my age. Now, I guess it’s probably mostly adults on\na nostalgia trip.\n\n\nThe point-and-click adventure in waiting. Waiting for the trees to grow.\nWaiting for adversaries to spawn, waiting for mineral ore to appear in\nthe rocks. RS’ world is scaled up to a speed that keeps players waiting,\nbut not too long. Not so long that progress feels halted. Cycles are\nquick enough for us to sit at the computer with baited breath, eagerly\nawaiting the next clic. And what’s more, it a resource is too crowded, a\nhundred parallel worlds are available.\n\n\n\n\nWaiting can be circumvented. The player is afforded enough control and\npower that the actions in game feel like meaningful progress.\n\n\nIt is the ideal game for limbo.\n\n\nIn pandemic, 4 friends and I got back into the game. “I’ve always wanted\naccess to this content” says one about the members-only stuff. Now a\nwork-from-home graphic designer, what better way to escape the condo of\nthe 50th floor above Toronto than into Gelienor? The so-called\nreal-world is stuck, we have no control, so the desire to make progress\nis well-suited to the game.\n\n\nRunescape accomplishes nothing useful. And how glorious, that nothing is\nproductive. No personal growth, no professional development, no\nupskilling. It can be said that playing an MMORPG is refusal to\ncapitalize on leisure time. A queer use of time; failure to behave.\nSimple indulgence in a designer world with quantifiable barometers of\nprogress that are attainable to any player willing to put in the\nnecessary time.\n\n\nI probably played it during my H1N1 infection, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer 2012\n\n\na lethal heatwave sweeps north America\n\n\nbut Maman and I are on vacation in Europe.\n\n\nI think it’s the second or third time I’m over there\n\n\nI’m having fun but I miss my girlfriend.\n\n\nIn Paris I took lots of rainy pictures\n\n\nwith a camera my high school teacher lent me for the summer.\n\n\nWe leave Paris by TGV to Montreux, Suisse.\n\n\nAfter a couple of days in bourgeois paradise\n\n\nwe drive up to visit friends in Château-d’Œx,\n\n\nfamous for its Balloon Week.\n\n\nI’m fine when we set out on the road\n\n\nbut after lunch I start feeling ill\n\n\nand am feverish by the time we make it\n\n\nto Maman’s friend’s home.\n\n\nWe think I’m just tired so I go to sleep\n\n\nafter taking a picture.\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Image taken in the Swiss alps, July 2012:\n\n\nForeground of verdant field leading up to a large wooden cabin\noverlooking a hill, with bright green window shutters open but windows\nclosed and white curtains pulled.

Background of mountainous peaks\nsparsely wooded against cloudy sky of cotton-candy clouds.\n\n\n\n\nI don’t have a solid grasp of how much time passes.\n\n\nI play that old Pandemic 2 flash

537 comments.\n\n\n\n\nMy bedsheets are changed regularly as I sweat profusely\n\n\nthe adults decide it’s time to get me to a hospital\n\n\nwhen blood shows up in my stoole.\n\n\nThe friend we’re staying with is a healer.\n\n\nOne afternoon I sit shivering across from her and we talk.\n\n\nShe peers into my 15 year old eyes and\n\n\nreveals to me my own fear of death.\n\n\nShe doesn’t have the medicine to stop the bleeding\n\n\nbut we hug and I feel impending doom leave my body\n\n\nin a rush of cathartic relief\n\n\nI’m hyperventilating \n\n\nmy lips quiver like my pulse is wholly\n\n\ncontained in that patch of split pink\n\n\nI can’t speak I try to breathe\n\n\nmy head rushes with light and the world implodes.\n\n\nI come back to my body slow and suddenly I’m aware\n\n\nof sunshine through wide windows in a room full of books.\n\n\nMaman and I take a small mountain train back to Montreux\n\n\nit’s a beautiful day and I devote my time\n\n\nin peaceful delirium to wondering\n\n\nwhat death feels like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall-town doctor says they don’t have the meds I need\n\n\nbut they do a blood test anyway\n\n\nso that the results might be in sooner.\n\n\nSoon enough, I’m in on a stretcher\n\n\nin an ambulance on a highway watching\n\n\nthe swiss scenery go by\n\n\nout the back window there’s not a lot of traffic.\n\n\nMaman is scared but relieved\n\n\nthat the travel insurance is taking care of the bill.\n\n\nI spend a night or two in Lausanne’s\n\n\nhigh-tech university hospital\n\n\nthere’s WiFi so really I’m decently happy.\n\n\nThe nurse takes my electronic music\n\n\nrecommendations before I check out\n\n\nI’m well enough to get on a plane so we fly back to Ottawa\n\n\nand to this day we do not know what I caught in the mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring 2017\n\n\nDreamt I’m strutting across the lobby of a hotel where I work retail,\n\n\npass the co-working space the bar the pool table and push aside\n\n\nthe hardwood door to one of the binary water closets.\n\n\nFind the room padded with sweltering black velvet walls floor ceiling\n\n\nall black all soft\n\n\nI begin to melt as I walk forward in a vain attempt\n\nto relieve myself in black porcelain\n\nbut instead I woke up to find my bed soaked in sweat.\n\n\nI take my temperature for the second time that night — 38.6C.\n\n\nI tried to keep the temp. down with acetaminophen\n\n\nbut I only delayed the inevitable.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s 2am, I gather up my necessities and take the night-bus south\n\n\nto l’Hôpital Notre-Dame because I’m too broke for a cab\n\n\nMaman is in another country for a conference.\n\n\nCalmly waltz into the ER take a number wait my turn, they’ve got my\nfile.\n\n\nEarlier that night I tried to lie to myself like\n\n\noh im just dehydrated i shouldn’t have had that last beer\n\n\nbut I felt fever’s omens before going to bed.\n\n\nFirst few years at conc-University basically each did the same thing to\nme\n\n\nI overworked underslept and ignored my body’s desire for rest\n\n\nuntil it was time to check in as a patient.\n\n\nWhisked through admissions they’ve got me in a bed\n\n\nan IV drip of broad-spectrum antibiotics and saline\n\n\nto keep me hydrated although No, we don’t know what I’ve caught.\n\n\nWhatever, fine, do a blood test a blood culture try to figure it out\n\nif it matters.\n\nI’m there a couple of days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack home, we burned your feet by spilling scalding golden tea that\nMaman had just handed over.\n\n\nShe’d gotten back that day from a trip abroad, a conference in Vegas,\n\n\nand I’d gotten home that day from hospitalization,\n\n\na couple of days at Notre-Dame.\n\n\nThat was the month I first read Sontag On Photography\n\n\nas well as the time my partner was mistaken for my sibling at bedside.\n\n\nIt was the summer I decided to try shooting film\n\n\nand I still haven’t developed all the rolls.\n\n\nI actually ended up burning the undeveloped rolls.\n\n\nIt’s the time, the only time, I asked the nurse if I could snapshot the\nIV being needled in.\n\n\nSo I’d just gotten home and Maman as well, from different journeys.\n\n\nScalding flesh with water I tore off the jeans I was wearing (I still\nwear that pair)\n\n\nand sat on the bed, looking up the right course of action on wikihow.\n\n\nSoaked my feet in lukewarm water but realized pretty fast\n\n\nas the bubbles formed on skin\n\n\nthat a doctor should probably have a look at this\n\n\nso maman helped me stumble to her car and we drove back to the hospital\n\n\nI had walked home from earlier the same day through MTL\n\n\nverdant spring holding hands feeling lively and fucking my friend\n\n\nwho was leaving for Toronto that afternoon.\n\n\nIn the interval between sex and getting burned\n\n\nI finished Sontag and decided to keep taking pictures\n\n\nbecause that seemed like a worthy endeavour.\n\n\n\n\nBack at the ER the nice doctor prescribes me morphine\n\n\nbut I smoke tea instead.\n\n\nPlatelet counts way too low, time to take a month off work\n\n\ndefer some exams and visit some family.\n\n\nPlatelets, for the uninitiated reader,\n\n\nare a component of blood generated in bone marrow\n\n\nthat serve to clot blood and heal wounds.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n\nlacking platelets, we bleed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing Air\n\n\n2020-05-05\n\n\n\n\nIn the midst of pandemic\n\nI have gone on some walks, sat in some municipal parks.\n\n\nOther people breathe nearby. I wonder where they’ve been recently.\n\n\nHow many of them bring a hospital’s airspace with them to the park?\n\n\nJust out of the allotted physical range,\n\n\nI’m aware that they are also breathing.\n\n\nThey talk and laugh and drink and smoke sometimes\n\n\nmaking the wind visible for a moment,\n\n\ninhale and exhale with the world atmosphere.\n\n\nWind catches my pores\n\n\ncarries my body dust along with each of yours\n\n\nso we conspire regardless of distance,\n\n\nbridging vast expanses across nothingness\n\n\nin order to be together.\n\n\n\n\nI live very far from the front lines.\n\n\nI don’t know what it’s like to live with combat nearby.\n\n\nAll I know of such places has come to me through images videos words,\n\n\nmost of my senses are spared the ample truth: the smells, the shock.\n\n\nI know only a fantasy, fictitious war.\n\n\nYet war and I share an atmosphere.\n\n\nWe breathe within one another.\n\n\nMy breath whispers: How simple, inhale exhale over again\n\nthe first to last thing we’ll ever do.\n\nIt’s the repetition that counts, one breath is nothing for the body, we\nneed air uncounted yet we account for a chemical regime, a specialized\ndiet of far more than oxygen which is poison anyway in overdose. The air\nwe share is a floating, transparent pharmacy not-so-carefully\ncalibrated, and precisely weaponized.\n\n\n\n\nPlease welcome the medics wherever there is fighting.\n\n\nWhat is there to gain from the veritable assault on human sensory\ncapacity, from mass death? I desire counter-offensive measures, but who\ndoesn’t? Anyone whose ever been hurt has tried retaliation, tried\nhurting back. Lately my reading has taken me into potential histories\nwhere men still wreak havoc, but others resist.\n\n\nThe air we share is risky, so we determine how much risk we’re willing\nto handle at a given moment. I conspire to emit air which filters out\nsuffering and positively impact any brief encounter. I share the results\nwith the inevitable passersby no matter which precautions we take. I\nwear a mask in public indoors and in close quarters but have given up on\nmasking myself for a stroll to the park.\n\n\nMy body is trying its best with what it knows of the long-winded lie\nthat is that there is self and there is other. I trust the precautions I\nam taking are enough for me and those I interact with. I trust the air\nwith my immune system. But I do not trust my body to visit a hospital\nright now. I am angry that it has to be this way, and I am scared. I do\nnot know what happens to my body when the numbers stop determining how\nit exists, but I do not want to measure the passing of time with numbers\nand test results.\n\n\nMy partner brings their world to me and we share stories whispering back\nand forth of then there here now conspiring liquid atmospheric\ncoalitions brewing. Limbo feels longer and shorter every single day.\nBreathing is a reminder of life as well as a way of giving thanks. Over\nfacebook messenger I ask my estranged father what worries him right now.\nHow many people will die, are dying, he says.\n\n\nI choose to continue sharing air. Circumstances may make that difficult\nor impossible. I choose this consciously, so I do not bow before\ninevitability. The inevitable does not rule me. Why should it? I treat\nthose inevitabilities I have learned as parts of the air and blood\nstreams.\n\n\nTouch screams, loud, when the body feels unknown skin. Brushed up\nagainst a cashier’s hand as they hand me a receipt, their mouth beyond\nthe counter’s plastic shielding. Our breaths shouldn’t mingle,\n\n\nI’m wearing a mask and hopefully they are too. Surface boundaries are\ntricky. Skin keeps the blood in, but it doesn’t keep the world out.\nAtunement to lived bodies has shifted.\n\n\n\n\nStating the obvious helps me stay grounded I guess,\n\n\nI think it’s because I’m used to my life-force being a numbers game.\n\n\nYou know, like stats in an RPG.\n\n\nTrying to min-max numbers to attain optimal efficiency.\n\n\nWe’re basically machines anyway right\n\n\nlike, so many dudes have said that\n\n\nseems ridiculous though idk.\n\n\nI think we’re more like mycelia\n\n\nor maybe trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Little Golden Cat\n\n\n2020-05-13\n\n\n\n\n\nMae slides by and I sense the displaced air,\n\n\na noticeable shift in housebound stillness.\n\n\nI do nothing but breathe and pick up the\n\n\ncharge of 2 human bodies\n\n\namidst home appliances and neighbours hidden away by walls.\n\n\nI’m lucky when I discern her specific scent from the others,\n\n\nwhen my sense of smell isn’t distracted by some noise.\n\n\nIf the fridge hums I can’t make her out.\n\n\nAbove the stove there’s one of those golden plastic cats\n\n\nwhose arm waves metronomically\n\n\nwith a little solar cell panel.\n\n\nA plastic Maneki-neko souvenir trinket.\n\n\nA seated cat, a bib around its neck, a bell or two,\n\n\na bastardized Japanese koban coin, a paw raised.\n\n\n\n\nLiterally a “beckoning cat,” the swinging arm’s\n\n\ntick-tacks are always audible,\n\n\nlike a clock that announces no time in particular when I deign to look\nover\n\n\nbut rather speaks only to its own presence\n\non that stove here in so-called montreal.\n\nI don’t know whether the cat ever stops beckoning a timeless now.\n\n\nAll it seems to accomplish is a reminder\n\nthat the old stove’s analog time-set is dysfunctional.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iconic beckoning cat appears to have originated\n\n\nin the late Edo period, feudal japan,\n\n\nand can now be acquired wholesale on Alibaba at the astonishing rate\n\n\nof up to five-hundred-thousand units per month, shipped out of Xiamen,\n\n\na city in the southeastern China beside the Taiwan Strait.\n\n\nThe Maneki-neko in this apartment was manufactured in China,\n\n\npassed quality control and imported to America,\n\n\nso say the embossments and sticker on the bottom,\n\n\nbefore being purchased and turned into a souvenir in this home.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 2 screws in the base that let me take it apart\n\n\nso I do, in the hopes that peering into the lucky cat’s innards will\nreveal\n\n\nsomething essential about the nature of time itself.\n\n\nWhat I find instead of a hollow metaphor\n\n\nis another series of plastic and metal components that come together\n\n\nto make up the swinging arm mechanism.\n\n\n\n\nLikely harvested anywhere on earth, mined out of deep\n\n\ntime’s accretion in the dirt and forged\n\n\nout of globalized myth—the golden cat is storied.\n\n\nThe Maneki-neko is a symbol of good fortune,\n\n\narising out of a story involving a destitute shop/temple/inn;\n\n\nthe poor proprietors take in a hungry and neglected cat.\n\n\nAfter being cared for and loved, the cat ventures out front,\n\n\nsits there and beckons to passers-by,\n\n\nthus shifting the fortunes of the establishment and bringing prosperity.\n\n\n\n\nWhose idea was this cultural export?\n\n\nDid they grow up with their own cherished cats either animate or carved?\n\n\nEither way they turned around and sold\n\n\nmyth down the river for capital gain\n\n\nbecause it seemed the logical thing to do.\n\n\n\n\nI don’t blame them but that doesn’t stop me\n\n\nfrom despising the swinging arm\n\n\nsometimes when I’m just breathing but then\n\n\nits tack tick tack tick sticks\n\n\nto my eardrum and I can’t shake off\n\n\nthis little cat’s little hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mention to Mae that I’m writing about this cat and learn\n\n\napparently she bought it years ago in NYC chinatown\n\n\nwhen roaming the streets as tourists with friends.\n\n\nOne of them was leading the group astray\n\n\neveryone was frustrated but ultimately souvenirs were purchased,\n\n\npacked up in suitcases, brought back to NB\n\n\nand eventually moved to MTL.\n\n\nSo the cat is here, from everywhere, signalling no time at all.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes when I’m lucky I lose my sense of object permanence.\n\n\nOut of willful forgetfulness comes a void full of nothing from which to\nlearn.\n\n\nThings fade in and out of thingness and cease their clutter.\n\n\nFor a time I get to forget what surrounds me, some of it,\n\n\nbreathe as if I weren’t aware that the objects that inhabit my\nday-to-day\n\n\nare fragments displaced from the earth entire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSympathie Sanguine\n\n\n2020-05-31\n\n\n\n\nBloodiness is a magnetism, an earthiness.\n\nObserving my own arms the veins are hills and tunnels. They bulge and\nrecess in turn. It’s commonplace for a nurse in a talkative mood to\ncomment on their quality.\n\n\nExpert appraisal has it: my veins are ripe for harvest.\n\n\nNot that any of us are too eager.\n\n\nNurses are labouring, sticking needles into veins\n\n\nfor days on end.\n\n\nMost nurses are highly skilled at this task.\n\n\nIt barely hurts. Commendable.\n\n\nI’m trying to imagine my own blood.\n\n\nCreate chances to hear it.\n\n\nRemembering follows loss, memory is split fragments\n\n\nreassembled in a whole different reality.\n\n\nBlood is a form of gravity.\n\n\nI’ll go back to the beginning.\n\n\n\n\nThe first blood test I remember came soon after blind gain.\n\n\nI was 5 years old at British Columbia Children’s hospital.\n\n\nThe blood draw clinic was a couple floors up from the hospital lobby.\n\n\nThe lobby had this massive plastic tree in it. Like 3 stories tall.\n\n\nWe took the elevator up and upon exit there were a series of signs to\nfollow.\n\n\nAll the walls on this level were painted sky blue\nand decorated with flying creatures, bears in aeroplanes,\nclouds rainbows sunshine you know, the usual hospital festivity.\n\n\nSo we follow the party to the clinic.\n\n\nWaiting room was pretty small, maybe 40 chairs.\n\n\nBlue walls. A TV somewhere in the corner.\n\n\nPulp magazines for parents to pretend-read.\n\n\nToys laid out on a table.\n\n\nArrival and check-in, a little window in the wall\n\n\nnext to a door through which we’d soon pass.\n\n\nWe, being myself, Maman,\n\n\nthe other kids and parents waiting.\n\n\nThe first time, I just sat there\n\n\nnot cognizant of what was about to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy feet didn’t reach the floor\n\n\nmaybe my legs were too short or the chair’s too long.\n\n\nSwung back-forth in ignorant anticipation or maybe simple boredom.\n\n\nWaiting rooms used to elicit boredom for me.\n\n\nI probably stared at the television,\n\n\nthe best way to forget a body before smartphones.\n\n\nI’ve noticed that most hospital waiting rooms\n\n\ndon’t have TV shows on anymore.\n\n\nAnd they don’t call people out by name.\n\n\nMaybe in the children’s hospitals they still do.\n\n\nAt the CHUM the teevees just have numbers on them\n\n\nand every time the numbers change there’s a Ding\n\n\nso everyone looks up\n\n\nonly to dash the patient hopes of all\n\n\nexcept one bored soul whose turn it finally is.\n\n\nAnyway at BC children’s in 2001\n\n\nthey called me by name and we passed into the back room,\n\n\nthrough a doorway, and then another,\n\n\neach room lined with stations\n\n\nhaving all the fixings needed for sanitary\n\n\nblood sample harvest.\n\n\nI’m led to the deepest section\n\n\nof blue-walled-room and sat in a too-big LUMEX\n\n\ndesigned for maximum clinical comfort.\n\n\nIt dawns on me why we’re here.\n\n\nWhile the nurse explains the procedure,\n\n\nI scream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore blood was medicine it was earth\n\n\nborn of generations sowing their seeds.\n\n\nFor all the talk of purity,\n\n\nco-mingling is the way of the world.\n\n\nAssume that blood itself exists in superposition\n\n\nand that blood is the locus of spirit.\n\n\nA mode of transition, transportation,\n\n\ntransmission, diffraction.\n\n\nIn the dirt, blood learns what comes of experimentation.\n\n\nAccording to Hebrew scripture,\n\n\nthe very life of the creature is in the blood.\n\n\n\n\nUn flot vivant cette boueuse rivière rouge pleine d’esprit.\n\n\nCela serait une grave erreur de penser que les histoires que chuchotent\nle sang sont sans conflits.

I am slowing down. Trying to connect\n\n\neach morning with hunger rather than immediately eating.\n\n\nEach day is one of heartbreak, healing, and love.\n\n\nMy longing is to know my body, keep it for a while,\n\n\nand know the place I am going to decompose before decomposing.\n\n\nGet to befriending the trees there, help the forest heal too.\n\n\n\n\nYears ago, my connection to the earth was ripped away by\nhospitalization.\n\n\nHospitals reared me as a pathological child,\n\n\nNow my doctor wants to see my blood within a month.\n\n\nPoison and cure, the body’s water is pharma’s locus, the bloodstream is\nwhy and how we get off.\n\n\n\n\nLiving blind within sickness,\n\nI used to trust wholly in medicine’s optics and chemistry.\n\nI was afraid of different things before.\n\nKnew less, and slowly awakened to death.\n\n\n\n\n\nI can’t imagine how the nurse’s hands are going to feel,\n\n\nbeing the second human’s touch since march.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s happened?\n\n\n(Slavery Shoah Monotheism Europe Colonies Ecocide)\n\n\nNothing, I’m fine.\n\n\nPeople say climate change, like change is so bad.\n\n\nOctavia Butler taught me God is change,\n\n\nas inevitable as love, life itself.\n\n\nThe whole cycle of infinitesimal parts\n\n\ntogether making matter and ether.\n\n\n\n\nWhy make a bloodbath of living?\n\n\nIs it out of fear that after-life is being withheld?\n\n\nYet change is very much alive,\n\n\nin all its bloodiness and its disease.\n\n\nHere’s how I feel lately: Civilization is not an inevitability.\n\n\nIt is an idea, humanity’s attempt at self-definition by fragmentation.\n\n\nHumanity’s prayer to death.\n\n\n\n\nNo one has ever told me I am going to die of an illness.\n\n\nNot before, not now.

Security guards mill about,\n\n\na nondescript hospital employee guides people where they need to go.\n\n\nDo you have an appointment? Where are you headed?\n\nCentre Intégré de Cancérologie, 14th floor,\nI’ve got a blood test today.\n\n\n\nOh, you know you have a separate entrance and elevators right?\n\n\nHere, this way, come with me.\n\n\nBy coming in through there, you won’t have to wander\n\n\nthe entire hospital or touch stuff that’s “disinfected”\n\n\nthough no one really cleans it.\n\n\nThank you, I say, and ponder the horror of that last statement as I\ndisinfect my hands again though I haven’t touched anything and make my\nway to the Oncology-Elevators. Two of us are whisked up in a\nsocially-distanced elevator ride. Maximum occupancy of 4, one person per\nfloor-sticker.\n\n\n\n\nUpstairs I am greeted by a nurse who asks the usual symptom-probes.\n\n\nThe nurse’s right hand brushes up against my palms as she leans in\n\n\nto spray sanitizer and disinfect me once more.\n\n\nI didn’t even press the elevator buttons.\n\n\nA volunteer in a polka-dot bow-tie\n\n\nwalks me down the long waiting room\n\n\nto point out the blood work reception desk,\n\n\nwhich has not moved in the 6 months since I was last here.\n\n\nI was supposed to return sooner, of course.\n\n\n\n\nThey’ve been working on adding a third even taller wing to the CHUM. In\nthe waiting room I always look down at the progress. Almost done now.\nNot just another hole in the ground.\n\n\nI used to get my blood tests done at Notre-Dame, an old old hospital on\nSherbrooke, opened in 1880. The CHUM, built in 2017, has another high\ncapacity blood-draw clinic on the main floor of D-wing, but I’ve never\nsat there in that glass box within the heart of the skyscraper complex\nwith no view outside for patients. For some reason I take the elevator\nto Oncology.\n\n\nOnce though I stayed overnight at the Nouveau-CHUM in an ER hallway on a\ncot under fluorescents. It was mid-march of 2019. I sat in receptive\nsilence, half-lotus, eyes closed, listening, not sleeping. Notice, the\noverworked nurses are torn between the desire to provide comfort and the\nexpectation of staying back, respecting the distance imposed by pain, by\nsickness. How does it feel to have disease constantly on your mind?\nEvery conversation I’ve had in the past week has either been about\nillness or violence.\n\n\nIn the morning my managing haematologist was on duty and came to see me\nat bedside.\n\n\nI said I’m fine.\n\n\nHe said\n\n\nYou’re not fine listen to these numbers.\n\n\nWe’ll up your dose of Revolade\n\n\nDeliver intravenous iron\n\n\nand Request an appointment with the gastroenterologist\n\n\nbecause surely if you’re this anaemic your stomach must be bleeding.\n\n\nAlright then, I guess.\n\n\n\n\nAs he discharges me, the doctor jokes\n\n\nabout how nice the rooms are up on the 15th floor,\n\n\nas if hospitalization is the right thing to chuckle warmly about.\n\n\nI think he’s well-intentioned and has a good grasp of haematological\n\n\nmedicine but I was glad to leave, go home,\n\n\nand spend a month in bed resting\n\n\nwhile the weather turned warm.\n\n\nOut the 14th floor waiting-room window I see the sky, the city, beyond.\n\n\nNearby another patient sits down and opens a book:\n\n\nThe Most Beautiful Quebecois Poems.\n\n\nI glance back outside\n\n\na small brown-speckled spider weaves its web\n\n\nacross the glass. From where I’m standing\n\n\nit’s bigger than the construction workers,\n\n\nbigger than the pedestrians, almost the size of the police cruiser\n\n\ntwo intersections away. Waiting there,\n\n\nrefusing to sit in the disinfected chairs,\n\n\nI wonder what good all the poetry in the world\n\n\nwill do this single arachnid\n\n\nspinning its home over Mooniyang.\n\n\n\n\nThe centre de prélèvements is a resolutely hygienic space.\n\n\nBlood draws occur 7am-3pm M-F.\n\n\nWait times are short for patients who get blood taken here up high.\n\n\nI ask a nurse how many blood tests a day she’s doing lately.\n\n\nIt depends, but a little over 100.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re checking my auto-immune system,\n\n\nit’s been known to eat away at me.\n\n\nPlatelets, also called thrombocytes,\n\n\nare tiny cells that are essential for normal blood clotting.\n\n\nWhen platelets are particularly low,\n\n\ninternal bleeding is a risk,\n\n\nand I get acutely aware of my skin’s surfaces\n\n\nits folds, distracted by specks of the outer world\n\n\nthat brush up against it, egg-albumin thin.\n\n\nThe circulatory system is a series of veinous corridors,\n\n\nhighways, canals, transit arteries carrying blood along.\n\n\nThe lightest pressure might bruise and the lightest scrape might tear.\n\n\nSo we test.\n\n\nSharp metal insertion somewhere along the arm. Middling.\n\n\nPrimary symptoms are: excessive bruising, bruising in excess of what one\nwould’ve expected for the amount of trauma, or bruises that are totally\nunexplained.\n\n\nWhen my daily life is asymptomatic, the blood work makes sure to rectify\nthe notion that everything is normal. Platelet counts outside the norm\nhave been my everyday for 19 years. I wonder whether we’ll get to stop\ncounting anytime soon?\n\n\nInternal bleeding’s a slow dissolving of veinous layers melding into a\ncontiguous ocean of blood. Carefully mapped out roads falling into\ndisarray as in-betweens flood. Microscopic terror as a shortage of\nplatelets leads to tidal waves overcoming the sea walls under\nmaintained, decimated by an overzealous team of white blood cells.\n\n\nIf this shows up to the naked eye at all, it’s usually as ‘petechiae’;\ntiny red pinpoints in the skin, little red-blue dots along the arms, the\nlegs, around the groin. Mini-bruises.\n\n\nEven invisible illness is subject to sight. Can we stop counting anytime\nsoon? Put blood under a microscope and find out just how its balance\nturns out. Break it down into categories for testing, count out with\nfrightening exactitude just how much of this that and whatever else my\nbody happened to contain at 7:32am on August 25th, 2020.\n\n\nMy haematologist’s job is precisely to make sense of the clinical\nminutiae contained within blood. Logic takes a crack at making sense of\nour lifeblood, and I can’t help but laugh.\n\n\nIt’s time I got out of here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSainte-Anne-des-Monts\n\n\n2020-11-11\n\n\n\n\nOù patientons-nous? \nl’aéroport\nen file d’attente\npour le courrier\npour que l’eau se mette à bouillonner\nlorsque le four se réchauffe\net à l’hôpital\n\n\n\nLe lit d’hôpital: lieu du patient; espace rituel; espace professionnel;\nintime; transportatif; hétérotopique; contemplatif; l’espace de la vie\nde la fin.\n\n\nDu lit, les patient.es observent l’action logistique d’un support vital\nhumain et machinique.

K, Iron)\n\n\nIt is a matter of being patient there with/in the organism.\n\n\nI am the golem and the druid both.\n\n\nLocating the philosophy and practice of healing oneself with/in blood.\n\n\nLa sang la moelle la peau les os les intestins.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the sensory receptors which detect chemicals in blood?

It sort of worked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking Back My Body\n\n\n2020-12-21\n\n\n\n\nAuto-immunity is a call to attend to one’s inner life.\n\nIt is my body signifying without language,\n\n\nin a grammar unique to my physiology,\n\n\nthat attention must be turned inward.\n\n\n\n\nThere is no goal, only process.\n\n\nLearning a sensory lyric leads ever deeper into itself,\n\n\nand isn’t that enough? Insight contains in its\n\n\ntwo syllables the entire experience.\n\n\nMy body is made in the process of encounters.\n\n\n\n\nAuto-immunity is far removed from the alleged\n\n\nself-destructive resistance of a biological system gone haywire.\n\n\nNot pathology, but compassion for a body, bodies,\n\n\nthat are unbounded from the physical contraint of materialism.\n\n\n\n\nSoma is the teacher along the path of self-compassion.\n\n\nNot a battleground. Not a machine. Not code. Not optional.\n\n\nPerhaps the only thing which is not optional:\n\n\none’s own flesh, sensation, and accompanying psyche.\n\n\nOnce alive, that is all there is.\n\n\n\n\nYet how much effort did I expend to forget? To escape?\n\n\nTo ignore the impulses with which you communicate with me?\n\n\nI am sorry. I wish I’d listened sooner.\n\n\nAt least my attention is devoted to you now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood flows for knowledge.\n\n\nOne must bleed, have bled, to seek.\n\n\nWho said autoimmunity is a dysfunction?\n\n\nIsn’t menstruation a form of autoimmunity?\n\n\nThen again, pharmacology removes such bleeding as well.\n\n\nAll the body’s bleeding, it seems, must be carefully managed,\n\n\nregulated rather than left to spontaneity.\n\n\nControl over blood is control over life.\n\n\n\n\nI shed concerns about the facts\n\n\nof body blood and autoimmunity.\n\n\nI am concerned solely with my first-person experience,\n\n\nmy own apprehension of flesh.\n\n\n\n\nA month has gone since I stopped my medication.\n\n\nThis morning upon waking my sheets\n\n\nhad left many smudges of red on my skin.\n\n\nI noticed in the shower.\n\n\nI told myself perhaps the pinpoint bruises\n\n\nare from the heavy straps of the grocery bags.\n\n\nSome petichia are apparent on my upper body, biceps, chest.\n\n\nMy stomach has goosebumps. Either from fear or cold.\n\n\nAnxiety gathers like black foam around my liver.\n\n\nTension in my gut as I wonder whether to eat,\n\n\nwonder what to eat. Few things are appetizing.\n\n\nI’m craving more meat, far less sugar.\n\n\n\n\nI gave up one upside (reliable platelet counts)\n\n\nwith many potential downsides.\n\n\nIn exchange for a downside\n\n\n(the return of thrombocytopenia),\n\n\nwith many potential upsides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 18 2020: Petichia appear on hands+wrists,\n\n\nespecially left side, around 5pm.\n\n\nLooking down at my hand and discovering it covered with bruises\n\n\nbrought a rush of anxiety bubbling up my spine\n\n\ninto an explosion of brain fog.\n\n\nNoise, monochromatic, crowding all sensation.\n\n\nLight-headed I lay down and discover my body is not in any pain.\n\n\nFear is mental, with physical effects.\n\n\nSymptoms nearly gone by 7pm.\n\n\n\n\nMorning Dec 19th: symptoms gone.\n\n\n\n\nThe process of healing is anything but linear.\n\n\nNo teleology of worse to better to best.\n\n\nOnly sickness, in waves.\n\n\nSitting with that.\n\n\nFeeling its variety.\n\n\nAutoimmunity is perhaps a harsh teacher.\n\n\nIts lessons are written in blood upon the moist parchment.\n\n\n\n\nAutoimmunity is perpetual.\n\n\nThe body is the nexus through which time is enacted in space.\n\n\nCyclical returns defy linear narratives of healing\n\n\npremised on empire’s prescriptive timeline\n\n\nof how a human life may be lived.\n\n\nSome see the body as static, preformed,\n\n\npre-determined biotechno-processes.\n\n\nAutoimmunity defies such simplistic reductionism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this an exit?\n\n\nI did not tell the medical staff I ceased my treatment.\n\n\nI look up from my phone\n\n\nwith the urge to plunge into a search for escape.\n\nDuckduckgo: “Monasteries in Canada”\n\nBut it is not so simple to heal.\n\n\nI am where I am, here, and I know I am staying put.\n\n\nThe weight of place and the weight of self.\n\n\nCommitment to new patterns exposes the rhythmic\n\ntides of solitary doubt.\n\nWhat am I so angry about? Why am I so confused?\n\n\nThe isolation is crushing, mulching.\n\n\nI feel like I’m composting my whole lived experience\n\nand it is infuriatingly slow.\n\nI feel like nothing is leading anywhere.\n\nLIMBO drags ever onward and back.\n\n\n\nThe body sweats out the chemistry and I\n\n\nstop costing the province 4500$/month.\n\n\nThe molecular coercion keeping my stem\n\n\ncells constantly productive fades away,\n\n\nand the truth of a body in mourning is allowed to reappear.\n\n\nMy grief is visible in the bruise\n\n\nthat takes two weeks to heal.\n\n\nIt is visible in the petechiae\n\n\nthat constellate my arms, thighs, feet.\n\n\nNotice grief when I shit\n\n\nand the t.p comes away splotched with fresh blood.\n\n\nHow do I live in a way that is not self-destructive,\n\n\nnot harmful to life, and reconcile that with grieving?\n\n\nWhy am I bleeding? What did I do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunion\n\n\n2021-01-207\n\n\n\n\nHow do I communicate with the invisible aspects of my\nbody,\n\nwith that which is occulted?\n\n\n\n\nThe occulted body is literally that which is the body unseen.\n\n\nKinaesthetic awareness. Motorsensory education. Somatic experience.\n\n\nBlood and tissue and all we ingest. Digestion is occult.\n\n\n\n\nInner alchemy, breath, the shifting locus of intentional focus.\n\n\nSensing blood and tissue and bone, the watery and the earthen self.\n\n\nThere’s no quantitative analysis available\n\n\nfor making rational sense of this relationship,\n\n\nthere is only a quality of divine apprehension\n\n\nthat may be glimpsed when I am allowed to return to the source.\n\n\nVoid of preconceived notions limiting what may be possible,\n\n\nI encounter a depth charge that shatters expectations.\n\n\nTaking the heart for a drum beat, beat, beat\n\never onward inward seeking not after answers\nbut for ever more precise questions.\n\nFor it is in the asking that insight is revealed.\n\n\n\n\nI pause, and wonder whether this journey is plausible.\n\n\nBalk at myself momentarily: “Ha! You’re in no position to understand.”\n\nYet shed these doubts, for if not I then whom?\n\nSurely no external measure no number holds the key to my flesh.\n\n\nIt is not written in law that I may not know myself.\n\n\nAny such contract is none that I have agreed to, and as such is one I\nreject.\n\nNo intermediary may intervene on my behalf,\nno priest/ess teach me what is true.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe needle interjects:\n\n\nI shall enumerate the reality of your blood.\n\n\nOnly if I should let it.\n\n\nAgain today I sat in a blue chair to bleed red\n\n\nfeed the sterile machinery. To what end?\n\n\n\n\nMonths without testing have left me alive,\n\n\nawake to internal life.\n\n\nA nurse asks: “Who told you to do that?”\n\n\nNo one, it was an autonomous decision.\n\n\nWe’ll see what the doctor has to say about the numbers\n\n\nabstracting my lifeblood, when we next speak on the phone.\n\n\n\n\nI know myself by practicing, by attempting,\n\n\nby sharing, by delving, by attending, by devotion.\n\n\nI seek the questions to illumine the body’s\n\n\niterative becoming, it’s multiplicity of discontinuities.\n\n\nNever shall I presume to have reached a conclusion.\n\n\nNever shall the flesh have revealed itself fully.\n\n\nTo make such presumptions is folly\n\n\nfrom there the inevitable decline.\n\n\nSo long as I maintain my ignorance,\n\n\nI have much to learn, so much to learn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week really kicked my ass. On a daily basis I whirl between depths\nand heights of confusion and certainty. I miss doing drugs. 2017-2019\nare marked by intermittent cannabis, psilocybin, LSD and DMT use.\nSeeking spiritual-scientific hyperthick multidimensionality. “Am I doing\nwhat I ought to be doing?” always on my mind. The short of it is that\nthere is no “should” or “ought.”\n\n\nPicked up Brothers Karamazov today; Ivan’s Grand Inquisitor, with his\npolemic against the Almighty, and man’s inability to handle freedom.\n\n\nAm I unable to handle freedom? What does freedom mean to me?\n\nWould I rather have my life dictated to me?\n\nI have been choosing to eat according to auto-immunity for a week,\n\nwith minor slip-ups.\n\nIt’s going okay. I called Maman last night to complain that it feels\nlike nothing I do is effectual. She reminds me:\n\nYou are undergoing huge transitions.\n\nAnd so I am.\n\n\nHere’s where I’m at:\n\n\nI live alone\n\n\nI don’t smoke\n\n\nI don’t drink\n\n\nI don’t watch TV\n\n\nI don’t watch Movies\n\n\nI don’t Follow The News\n\n\nI don’t drink coffee\n\n\nI don’t eat grains\n\n\nI don’t eat legumes\n\n\nI don’t eat sugar.\n\n\nI sit in contemplation\n\n\nI read books\n\n\nI cook for myself\n\n\nI go on walks\n\n\nI talk to friends\n\n\nI visit my grandmother\n\n\nI sleep\n\n\nI listen to selected podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dreams lately have been about learning, workshopping, being taught by\nmany teachers. I hear that when the student is ready, the teachers\nappear. I believe my mystery school is in my unconscious. There, and\nalso on the internet, in the texts. I want to live a mystical life, a\nmagical life, a mysterious life, an enchanted life, a godly life, a\ndaoist life, a natural life, a simple life, a good life.\n\n\nAnd I wonder, what does that mean?\n\n\nLove and Joy and Sex and Compassion and Strategy and Ritual and Passages\nand Thinking and Speaking and Birthing and Decaying and Growing and\nSowing and Reaping and Listening and Singing and Shouting and Seeing and\nFreezing and Heating. No deficiency and no excess. Always cycling back.\n\n\nImperfection reigns here. Amidst confusion, I breathe in out deep as\never possible but I feel bloated, weighed down by the unknowns. Why is\nmy body this way? How did it come to be? What can I do? Do the\nnot-doing, says the Dao. Therein lies a key, for certain. Wu Wei helps\nme glean new insight, new possibilities. Ever a quest for such avenues\nas yet unexplored.\n\n\nThis way or that? A new path or old? Am I here for myself or for\nanother? Are we together or apart? I’ve never ceased exploring, all I\ncan say is that rational sense is overrated. I don’t want your logic,\nyour boxes. But I’m trying to understand how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegressing Moves Forward\n\n\n2021-02-01\n\n\n\n\n9am, I take 25mg Revolade.\n\nFirst dose since November.\n\n\nYesterday a bruise appeared spontaneously on my right hand ring finger\nwhile I walked to Mamie’s. I am accepting the efficacy of medicine, I\nsuppose. I am not going to let my body self-destruct while I scramble\nfor alternatives. No, I will instead find safe, stable ground from which\nto carry on. This decision feels like failure, like admitting defeat.\n\n\nAuto-immunity tells me the world is toxic, the body rebels, and I must\nrespond in the ways that best assure my quality of life. I am saddened\nthat I must remain in this particular entanglement, with this particular\nmolecule. Why? Why does this remedy bother me? Is it purely the cost? Am\nI so opposed to medicine or to profit? Have I not been treated well? Why\nfight?\n\n\nI want to collaborate with the chemistry activating my bone marrow.\nThank you, Pharmacy, for making it possible that a small daily pill lead\nto the generation of more numerous blood platelets. Indeed, such\nprecision is miraculous and ought not be shunned outright. This return\nto treatment is not failure, it is a testament to the non-linearity of\nhealing. I now have a simple confirmation and perhaps that is what I\nsought.\n\n\nI am still auto-immune. The beauty and chaos of winging it is that\nultimately there are no wrong answers. The autonomy of embodied life\nlies in choosing how to interpret one’s relation to the world.\n\n\n\n\nThe summer before first grade there was a heatwave in QC City. Maman was\nlooking for a job, for a place to live, for a school. I was going to\nday-camp. I’d been sick/blind nearly a year. We left Vancouver to be\ncloser to family, to save money. First week of camp I got up the courage\nto stay overnight with the other kids. First day of first grade I didn’t\ngo to school because Maman couldn’t bring me. Instead my sitter, some\ncollege student, asked me what I wanted to do that day. Movies or\nmuseums? Easy choice, museums. The oldest colonial city on Turtle Island\nhas excellently stocked imperial showrooms, no doubt.\n\n\nIt is not that the sick child is not talked about, or even invisible.\n\n\nWe have our own hospitals, TV spots, fundraisers.\n\n\nRather the sick child is monstrous, abhorrent, pitiable.\n\n\nThe sick child is voiceless. A body to whom things happen;\n\n\nunfortunate, sad, oh-im-so-sorry things.\n\n\nThe sick child in Canada is an icon.\n\n\nAlways the first victim, the most vulnerable.\n\n\nThe most susceptible to environmental racism and differential\ngovernance.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I got diagnosed, my single mother quit her job\n\n\nrelied on the goodwill of friends.\n\nWe didn’t have health insurance anyway.\nWhy would we? Canada’s got it covered, right?\n\nBut so-called “universal healthcare” only applies to certain treatments.\n\nMy mother went into debt to keep her sick child treated.\n\nIn The Argonauts, Maggie Nelson’s third-party account of their child\nsays Iggy “couldn’t care less” at having his body handled by medicine.\nThis is an example of an adulthood shrug, Maggie’s ignoring the\nsignification of testing upon a body that will bear the (in)visible\nmarks of illness for its entire life, as many of us do. But Trauma does\nnot preclude joy. Is medical intrusion necessarily, inherently\ntraumatic?\n\n\nThe (chronically, terminally, irreparably) sick child is a poster,\n\na footnote, a statistic by which institutions\nseek funding and conduct research.\n\nIggy is reified as a statistic in Nelson’s account\n\n\nbecause their mother could not resist the lure\n\n\nof the exceptional sick child who pulls through despite the odds.\n\n\n(just like me, dear reader, hurrah)\n\n\n\n\nThe sick child is the object of fascination\n\n\nin countless books, studies, memoirs of parenthood,\n\n\nsermons and prayers, and many, many oil paintings.\n\n\nThe narrative is almost always the same:\n\n\nYears of mis-diagnosis, disbelief by doctors,\n\n\nsuffering, as life is turned topsy-turvy\n\n\n(How could this happen to us?)\n\n\neventual acceptance\n\n\nand barely veiled moralizing\n\n\nabout the myth of recovery\n\n\n(aren’t we all sick anyway?)\n\n\nThe parent of the sick child is afraid, so afraid. What worse fate than\nto hold your child’s hand as they whither away, body seemingly turned\nagainst itself, unable to walk, a fading living limbo.\n\n\nMemoirs of sickness (this one included)\n\n\nare fetishistic at best, romantic doldrums at worst.\n\n\nIs anyone really interested in our hundreds of E.R visits?\n\n\nWhy? The emergency room is a circle of hell.\n\n\nIt is boring, tiresome, and smells awful.\n\n\nLike barely preserved decomposition.\n\n\nA healthy reader picks up an illness memoir to glimpse life in That\nOther Place, crosses themselves and kisses their healthy child’s\nforehead: “Please God, may such a thing never befall our family.” But of\ncourse, sickness isn’t so easily warded off.\n\n\nIt is not the intention of this text to say: Ignore doctors! Any reading\nwhich takes that to be the point is shallow at best. Once, clearly, for\nthe record: Medical practice is at times essential and life-saving.\n\n\nNor is this tract a call to internet-search quackery. What is essential\nis bodily self-knowledge, and an end to total reliance upon the tools of\nexperts with an MD. I am writing to give shape to the fury, and thus\ncease being merely patient, merely sick.\n\n\n\n\nWe never complained of poor treatment.\n\n\nI wrack my memory now for instances\n\n\nof incompetence or negligence.\n\n\nAll I can say for my case is that sometimes\n\n\na nurse would fail to do their duty with a needle,\n\n\nand many pinpricks were made where one should have sufficed.\n\n\nBut what is one needling among hundreds?\n\n\nThere are banal instances of bother\n\n\ncommon to inpatient life\n\n\n(getting to the washroom with an IV pump? Annoying.)\n\n\nbut over time one gets habituated quite well.\n\n\nFor some years I felt that it is much preferable\n\n\nto be in a hospital if one is sick.\n\n\nWhere better?\n\n\nMy logic was that the odds of survival\n\n\nmust be greater in such a place.\n\n\nNow I’m not always so sure.\n\n\n\n\nThe only real complaint I have is the food,\n\n\nand perhaps that’s why\n\n\nI don’t think of hospitalization\n\n\nas necessarily beneficial, now.\n\n\nHow is anyone supposed to get stronger eating white bread,\n\n\ncorn flakes, mashed potatoes, and juice from concentrate?\n\n\n\n\nBut I forget myself, and hear now clearly\n\n\nthe inevitable retort:\n\n\nFree healthcare though!\n\n\nYes indeed,\n\n\nbut how much does the endless IV drip really cost?\n\n\nIt’s a matter of method, of priorities, of budgeting.\n\n\nWhat contracts underlie the treatment practices\n\n\nin public institutions?\n\n\nWhat long-term commitments to pharmacy?\n\n\n\n\nAuto-immune is itself a word\n\n\nthat would do violence to the wholeness of being,\n\n\nA rejection of self by self, a biological self-loathing.\n\n\nRepent! For thy cells do you wrong. I reject this morality.\n\n\nAuto-immunity is not an individual state of being.\n\n\n\n\nBut what better turn of phrase?\n\n\nI’ve given up on explanation,\n\n\nand will content myself with stating:\n\n\nIf I am to heal, it is because I am kind\n\n\nto the cells that compose me.\n\n\n\n\nHow much youth uselessly buried?\n\n\nMaybe home will be discovered in writing about you.\n\n\nRaised and medicated near and far from our birthplace,\n\n\nyet always rootless, treading chlorinated water.\n\n\nTaking it slow has revealed a hollowness where a spleen used to rest\n\n\nand in the nodes of a liver recuperating.\n\n\nWhat we’re doing here is writing up blueprints, cryptic as any other.\n\n\n\n\nKnowing my body is sacred activism.\n\n\nIt once seemed abhorrent in every way.\n\n\nMonstrous, without divinity.\n\n\nYears of setting you down on the page,\n\n\npages of organs, of shattered conceptions,\n\n\nof disavowal, of leaning into gravity.\n\n\nWould that these pages held\n\n\nreams of philosophical nuance\n\n\nwhere instead only fragments of experience are laid bare.\n\n\n\n\nHow sick and pitiable some reader may find us.\n\n\nYou, a bloody mess. Me, frantically attempting to make sense of it all.\n\n\nThe modes of address are idiosyncratic at best,\n\n\ndisjointed on average, incomprehensible at worst.\n\n\nSo what? These pages are yours and mine,\n\n\nshared with the world but never bowing to its demands for propriety.\n\n\n\n\nI’m after is a sort of sanguine seeing.\n\n\nA blood sight\n\n\nthrough which genealogy may be known and harnessed.\n\n\nWhat I came to realize is that Revolade occluded the possibility\n\n\nof knowing the blood that flows through me as my own.\n\n\nBlood remains ever co-mingled with, well, everything.\n\n\n(How do the Californian grapes that I am eating change my physiology?)\n\n\nIt is a matter of gaining more minute control over what we absorb.\n\n\nVoluntary detoxicity where possible.\n\n\n\n\nFoods have subtler impacts than pharmacy but also offer fewer risks.\n\n\nLeave fewer traces and are (perhaps) less resource intensive to create.\n\n\nWhy exactly is a 28-day course of 75mg Revolade 4500CAD?\n\n\nSurely the ingredients aren’t so cost intensive?\n\n\nHow are global supply chains mobilized\n\n\nto create thrombopoetin receptor agonists?\n\n\nPutting these questions down in writing hurts,\n\n\nin the way confronting any unpleasant unknown may hurt.\n\n\nPrior to finding factual answers, I can only speculate that what I find\n\n\n(if indeed such information is traceable)\n\n\nwill reinforce a hatred of vertically integrated exploitation\n\n\nwith new details telling me what I basically already know.\n\n\nSo why hunt? Why seek out the nitty-gritty? Must we?\n\n\n\n\nSadness and hunger are often confusedly intermingled feelings.\n\n\nDeep in the gut, clenching tension.\n\n\nI’ll regularly eat when I’m already sated just to quench the feeling.\n\n\nI’ve only recently realized this. It’s difficult to admit to myself that\nI am sad.\n\n\nThat the muscular holding impulse is a defence mechanism\n\n\nI developed to shield me from my feelings.\n\n\nA tight muscle hides sensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy gut acts as a barrier between the upper and lower places of the body.\n\n\nRight around my centre of gravity at the navel is where tension hides.\n\n\nHonest feeling reveals that the impulse to eat right after lunch\n\n\nstems from a fear of digestion.\n\n\nBoth food and emotion require parasympathetic integration.\n\n\nIt’s not yet clear, the source of this specific habit.\n\n\nThere are any number of reasons to avoid integrating/digesting\nnegativity.\n\n\nWhat I know now is that without making space inwardly for the sorrow to\nebb and flow, it will inevitably overrun the territory, as rivers caught\nbehind a dam. Flooding damages so many disparate and interconnected\naspects of self/world ecology. Superficial methods for instant\ngratification (A snack!) bloat the canals of feeling where/when sadness\nmay be felt deeply, as not merely pain, but as an essential marker of\nenfleshed reality. As above, so below. If I do not allow the body to\nbecome hungry, I will not discover what it desires and, by the same\ntoken, what it needs.\n\n\nThe thrombopoetin receptor agonist I took for 5 years had the medically\npalliative effect of (mostly) maintaining my body’s platelet counts\naround the normal range. The drug also comes with a long list of\nside-effects, chief among which is anaemia. Funny, the doctors were\nunable to find the source of the anemia detected through blood work, so\nI took huge iron supplements for three years.\n\n\nNone of us thought to consider ceasing the main pill. Instead, more\ntests, more pills, more needles. Absurd.\n\n\nA phone call from the gastroenterologist:\n\n\nHer voice rings hollow with cavernous surprise\n\n\nupon learning my body’s iron eventually corrected itself\n\n\nwithout their pills or needles.\n\n\nShy, I suggest the medicine may have been a culprit.\n\n\nShe disagrees, but is pleased\n\n\nthat her needless test\n\n\ncan still make it into the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am living through a whirlwind right now.\n\n\nI feel physically renewed,\n\n\neach day more attuned to needs.\n\n\nPhysically awakening to overwhelming optionality.\n\n\nEach day assailed with endless What Ifs.\n\n\nSome acts are underway.\n\n\nSome future worry seeps into the daily where it needs not.\n\n\nMy dreams are teachers.\n\n\nThe world’s inexorable advance continues shifting.\n\n\nA day contains so much yet so little.\n\n\nA night so short yet so expansive.\n\n\nWho said anything about winning and losing?\n\n\nWhat about letting go of focus? Practice.\n\n\nSometimes I am anxious to get going.\n\n\nOther times staying put is bliss.\n\n\nCertain decision are within my control,\n\n\nand many uncertainties exist without.\n\n\nDo I seek simple passive comfort? No.\n\n\nAm I after integrated wellbeing? Surely.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the well meaning friend\n\n\nto the polemical witch,\n\n\neveryone agrees:\n\n\nOne must first heal oneself.\n\n\n\n\nNo need to create harsh laws of self-rule.\n\n\nSuch discipline is not only joyless, it is harmful.\n\n\nDo what is of interest, and nurture ongoing discovery.\n\n\nCertainly, some things are better avoided,\n\n\nbecause we have learned through trial and error\n\n\nthat bone and blood respond poorly to exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis extends into the mediatic.\n\n\nDon’t ingest harmful thoughts needlessly,\n\n\nand allow time for digesting the emotions that arise from encounters.\n\n\nWe are not in a hurry.\n\n\nCalls to productivity are best ignored outright. A diagnosis of\nautoimmunity blames the individual bodyfor shortcomings in the world.\nMedicine refuses to acknowledge that 24/7 lives of submission to capital\nare inherently sick demand, and thus turns suffering inward, as though\nevery doctor were Nietzsche diagnosing the Christians. When medicine\nspeaks of auto-immunity it does not mean a body evoking demands to\nattention.

It is rest.\n\n\nWhat your body desires is an exit from alarm clocks,\n\n\nand a rhythm of its own. Our cells breathe at their own pace.\n\n\nIt’s a withdrawal from the incessant poison of empire that heals.\n\n\n\n\nI suppose I am in search of a cure. That’s the ‘reward’ around which\nI’ve been orienting my life, my striving. Unconsciously. Would it be\nbetter to seek cure consciously? Or to strive for acceptance and\nreconciliation with what is?\n\n\nI love this flesh; it is all I know. Sorry: that it must harm itself.\nGrieving for the blood shed inward. For why must a body be toxic? In\nthat question the endeavour: How is the human body made toxic?\n\n\nA record of treatment turns the ongoing chronicity of healing into a\npast cure, a fait accompli. The slew of blood tests fixes a fictionally\nstatic count of my body in time where a living organism is always\nshifting and responding to worldly cycles\n\n\nI have not spontaneously ceased this mode of self-defence. I have not\nentered a new realm of embodiment by changing locales and breathing new\nair. My existence is essentially continuous. I may not know where I’ll\nend up, or even where I’m going, but for the time being I sense that I’m\ndoing what I can to live a life of truth, harmony. Not pushing\nneedlessly in a direction that won’t have me, but feeling in the dark\nfor those secure handholds, where a latch awaits my touch. I do not mean\nthat the path must be easy—rather, that it must carry that distinct\nfeeling-tone of rightness.\n\n\nAll I really know is that I wake up each day, thankful for the gift that\nis life. I am assailed by doubt and uncertainties. What is there to\nensure that the world has meaning? I choose to believe the order has its\nown reason, which I may never grasp. The human answers do not satisfy\nme, even when those lives ordered by such stories appeal greatly.. The\nonly certainty is the is-ness of flesh. Through this is, the world is\nsensed in turn. Sensation is divine nature, the great teacher. Confusion\nis an aspect of the flesh, when the grandeur of sensing relations\noverwhelms the conscious. The flesh itself knows no limits, and may\nperceive the oneness of is-ness when left to sense without interference\nfrom my mind.\n\n\nThis is why it pains me to ingest pharmacology’s product. It stretches\nand expands the flesh according to logics I do not comprehend. It\nactivates my body as if it were separate from the mind—leaving me to\nmake sense of the flesh’s entangled nature all on my own. I am furious\nat the lack of guidance afforded me. None explain their reasoning:\nRecommendations come as blanket prescriptions, as band-aids. Is no one\nlooking causation, for cure?

labour, paid and unpaid,\n\n\nof the late-capitalist 24/7 economy.\n\n\n\n\nA patient with internet access can socialize,\n\n\nwork, and engage with the world’s happenings in realtime\n\n\n“Since no moment, place, or situation now exists\n\n\nin which one can not shop, consume, or exploit\n\n\nnetworked resources, there is a relentless incursion\n\n\nof the non-time of 24/7 into every aspect\n\n\nof social or personal life.“ (Crary again)\n\n\n\n\nThe existing literature treating internet usage by hospital inpatients\n\n\ndeals primarily with increasing patient engagement\n\n\nof online health portals.\n\n\nIn 2015, a survey examined the use of mobile devices\n\n\namong hospitalized patients in a large urban Californian hospital,\n\n\nwith the goal of determining how many patients\n\n\na) brought devices to the hospital with them, and\n\n\nb) used their devices to access their personal health record.\n\n\n\n\nThis paper says that 68% of surveyed patients brought\n\n\nat least 1 mobile computing device,\n\n\nthe largest determining factor for device use was age,\n\n\nrather than insurance status or race/ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n79% of people under the age of 65 used a device,\n\n\n27% of people over 65 did.\n\n\n\n\n48% of device users accessed their health data,\n\n\n79% of device users used their device for ‘entertainment/games’\n\n\n\n\nThe authors do not expand on what is meant by ‘entertainment/games’\n\n\nAs of writing, no further surveys have been conducted\n\n\nwhich examine the ways in which hospitalized patients spend their time\nonline.\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, the advent of wireless internet in hospitals is a\nrelinquishing of control\n\n\nover the channels of information available to patients.\n\n\nCaregivers no longer need to manage media consumption on top of\nhealthcare.\n\n\nThe internet acts as a pacifier, a thumb stuck in the mouth,\n\n\nproviding distraction from embodied experience\n\n\nand facilitating willful amnesia about pain and sickness,\n\n\nwhich lessens the burden of emotional labour the nurses must exert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Surveiller et Punir, Michel Foucault made explicit the “force\nsecrète”\n\n\nwhich alleges a mandate of personal betterment for its subjects.\n\nMeaning: Discipline Helps You Get Better\n\nThe exertion of biopower is nowhere more visible than in hospitals,\n\n\nwhich create an isolating environment\n\n\nallegedly suitable for bodily healing,\n\n\nrather than isolation in the name of punishment.\n\n\n“L’isolement constitue un ‘choc terrible’ à partir duquel le condamné,\néchappant aux mauvaises influences, peut faire un retour sur soi et\nredécouvrir au fond de sa conscience la voix du bien”\nSurveiller et punir, p.145\n\n\nAre the sick condemned to repent?\n\n\nThe insular nature of the hospice bed\n\n\ncuts off the inpatient from the outside\n\n\nand its ‘unhealthy’ atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nIt is in the name of cure, the betterment of patients,\n\n\nthat a sick body is processed and tracked.\n\n\nA body must be on its best behaviour\n\n\nin order to undertake the necessary labour of rest and repair.\n\n\nHospital time is unfixed—shifting dependent on a body’s receptivity to\ncure.\n\n\n\n\nWith regard to internet usage,\n\n\nthe policies are framed as being in the best interest of patient health,\n\n\nyet make an implicit moral judgement about pornography\n\n\nand about the sexuality of patients.\n\n\nIt seems to me that the restriction of pornography\n\n\namounts to an important barrier of the potential\n\n\nfor a sexual identity among hospitalized patients.\n\n\nThe browsing restrictions built into the public WiFi\n\n\nserve as a moralizing proscription on the rights of adults\n\n\nto access legal materials online,\n\n\nas well as a prohibition of their identities as sexual beings.\n\n\n\n\nThe restrictions surrounding pornography in the hospital\n\n\nserve to further stigmatize groups of people already touted as asexual,\n\n\nand prevent patients from a common avenue\n\n\nfor sexuality, should they desire to engage.\n\n\n\n\nThe hospital’s mission is explicitly\n\n\nto promote health and well-being.\n\n\nThey aim to “facilitate healthy choices”,\n\n\n“lead meaningful interventions”,\n\n\nand facilitate “free and enlightened decision-making.”\n\n\n\n\nThat means condemning behaviours and habits\n\n\nthat may be detrimental to mental and physical wellness.\n\n\nThe public conversation’s effacement of sexual pleasure\n\n\nas a valuable part of daily life works hand-in-hand\n\n\nwith the dominant view that chronically ill people\n\n\ncould not possibly be concerned with sexuality\n\n\nto create a habitat that doesn’t think twice about denying\n\n\nits residents access to sexually explicit materials.\n\n\n\n\nBodies learn behaviours and habits when led by example.\n\n\nHere, bodily discipline is enforced by creating barriers to sexually\nexplicit material\n\n\nobviously linked with masturbation and sexual pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nThere are reams of papers showing that in clinical contexts,\n\n\npornography consumption is restricted to sanctioned medical uses\n\n\nsuch as research or “sexual rehabilitation” programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower over the acts permitted an individual is central\n\n\nto the formation of docile bodies;\n\n\ndisciplinary power creates a correlation\n\n\nbetween action and state of embodiment:\n\n\n“le contrôle disciplinaire ne consiste pas simplement à enseigner\n\n\nou à imposer une série de gestes définis;\n\n\nil impose la relation la meilleure\n\n\nentre un geste et l’attitude globale du corps” (p.178)\n\n\n\n\nDiscipline of embodied gestures is inextricably linked\n\n\nwith the betterment of a body’s behaviour.\n\n\nIn the case of health, if pornography is unhealthy,\n\n\nthen one must not be allowed to consume this poison\n\n\nwhen attempting to cast off other ills,\n\n\nor healing as a whole is jeopardized.\n\n\n\n\n“La punition est une technique de coercition des individus; elle met\nen oeuvre des procédés de dressage du corps avec les traces qu’il\nlaisse, sous formes d’habitudes, dans le comportement; et elle suppose\nla mise en place d’un pouvoir spécifique de gestion de la peine. Le\nsouverain et sa force, le corps social, l’appareil administratif. La\nmarque, le signe, la trace…”\nSurveiller et Punir, p.155\n\n\n\n\nThe patient’s experience is also one of attempting\n\n\nto forget one’s position,\n\n\nin order to allow time to pass more quickly.\n\n\nOne finds ways to distract oneself.\n\n\nIn my experience, every patient has their media of choice.\n\n\nReading, music, movies, games, social networks, work.\n\n\nAnything goes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular transfusion treatments and their side-effects\n\n\nmake it more difficult to reliably commit the time\n\n\nthat is demanded of the worker.\n\n\nHospitalization may force people to take\n\n\nsignificant amounts of time off work,\n\n\nif they are able to hold down a regular job.\n\n\n\n\nIVIG further impinges on a patient’s extra time,\n\n\ncompressing their opportunities for rest\n\n\ninto greater scarcity. The time carefully set aside\n\n\nfrom work becomes time to catch up\n\n\non the productive obligations\n\n\nthat medical commitments trespass upon.\n\n\nBeing a patient is unpaid work;\n\n\nwork that often requires paying to access;\n\n\nwork that actively takes away the resources\n\n\nacquired through productive labour.\n\n\n\n\nPatients are expected to work on their health.\n\n\nCrary’s book frames its discussion around sleep,\n\n\nwhich “in its profound uselessness and intrinsic passivity,\n\n\nwith the incalculable losses it causes in production time,\n\n\ncirculation, and consumption […] will always collide\n\n\nwith the demands of a 24/7 universe.”\n\n\nPrior to internet connectivity, hospitalized time\n\n\nfunctioned similarly to sleep vis-a-vis capitalism.\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of transfusions,\n\n\nit is required that the patient remain passively\n\n\nin place for the duration of the treatment\n\n\nand allow their body to do the slow work of chemical absorption.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, unlike sleep, the waking mind is still active during this time.\n\n\nThe patient is still a consumer, and with the arrival of WiFi\n\n\nin many hospitals and clinics it has become possible,\n\n\nperhaps necessary, for many chronically ill individuals\n\n\nto perform two occupations simultaneously: patient and worker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24/7 demands I forget about myself,\n\n\nfocus instead on the always-on world\n\n\nof production and consumption.\n\n\n\n\nThe parallel procedures of donation and transfusion\n\n\nare thus drawn together through internet access.\n\n\nWhile the donors and patients are alienated from their bodies\n\n\nby necessity, either for money or for cure,\n\n\nthey engage in the legible act of consumption.\n\n\n\n\nIf there’s no getting better, patients learn to work through it.\n\n\nFor people who are at the hospital regularly,\n\n\nit is not a vacation or an opportunity to focus on healing.\n\n\nIt is a part of the routine that must be accounted for\n\n\nin one’s crip-time management. One may ask oneself:\n\n\n“how much time do I need off work each month for this,\n\n\nfor the foreseeable future?”\n\n\n\n\nAlison Kafer meditates on ‘prognosis time’, calling it\n\n\n“a liminal temporality, a casting out of time; rather than a stable,\nsteady progression through the stages of life, time is arrested,\nstopped. Paradoxically, even as the very notion of ‘prognosis’ sets up\nthe future as known and knowable, futurity itself becomes tenuous,\nprecarious. But this very precariousness can […] become an impetus\nfor erotic investment in the present, in one’s diagnosed body.”\nFeminist, Queer, Crip, p. 36\n\n\nTo invest oneself in the present, in embodied experience,\n\n\nis a fundamental departure from capitalism.\n\n\nPaying attention to the material realities of treatment\n\n\nand the immediate situation, rather than ignoring them\n\n\nand hoping they pass, is a radical form of acceptance.\n\n\n\n\nIn the hospital chair of a WiFi-enabled institution\n\n\nthe networks of crip time and 24/7 careen into one another\n\n\nwithin one sick millennial’s laptop open to messenger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting\n\n\n2021-04-10\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been waiting for waiting to happen.\n\nAnd what do I do while I wait?\n\n\nGet dragged into computing habits staring at a screen\n\n\nwatching television eyes burning into my sockets.\n\n\nSmoking cannabis passing the time reminding myself\n\n\nthat waiting for the sake of waiting is not necessarily time lost.\n\n\nJournaling and omitting to transcribe,\n\n\nnot really sure what to do now\n\n\nthat certain projects are in another’s ballpark.\n\n\nHello, is anyone out there?\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\nWhat do I think?\n\n\nI think I have to keep practicing\n\n\nand apply myself for the sake of myself,\n\n\nnot apply to work useless jobs.\n\n\nWould be nice for my days to feel substantial\n\n\nbut I can settle for early mornings\n\n\nout by the water moving what little qi I have.\n\n\nFrustrated some days that I have no one to share with,\n\n\nno teachers, no partners.\n\n\nOnly distant relations. No friends, really.\n\n\n\n\nSure, I know people, but what’s a friend?\n\n\nSomeone with whom to build life and share knowledge.\n\n\nThe people now in my life are on paths\n\n\nI find ultimately meaningless.\n\n\nIs that cruel?\n\n\nI suppose it’s best that I find my own life\n\n\na more interesting affair than any other,\n\n\nbut that does not lessen the burden\n\n\nof waking up and feeding myself, alone.\n\n\nThe weight of solitude turns me into a petty creature,\n\n\nstaving off boredom in what ways I can\n\n\nI slowly develop an ascesis\n\n\nthat will lead somewhere worthwhile.\n\n\nBut in pandemic it feels like nothing is worth doing, somedays.\n\n\nEven the most beautiful, the most powerful acts,\n\n\nthey fall short in my little solipsism.\n\n\nMagic, meditation, breathing, movement,\n\n\nthe forest,\n\n\nthe water.\n\n\nNone of it helps.\n\n\nCannabis helps, but only for an hour or two.\n\n\nThat’s not any good.\n\n\nMushrooms help, but imperceptibly.\n\n\nFrustrating, frustrating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVein To Vial, continued\n\n\n\n\nBut I digress, and \n\nmeanwhile, the needles do their own work.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the patient arrives for treatment,\n\n\na nurse measures body weight in order to determine\n\n\nthe speed and volume of the dose.\n\n\nThey prepare the intravenous catheter and ensure its proper functioning.\n\n\nThey program the pump, which is designed with the assumption\n\n\nthat its operators have a degree of medical knowledge\n\n\nto allow them to make sense of its many features and safely operate it.\n\n\nNurses keep track of the infusion rate,\n\n\nthe liquid’s volume, the patient’s vitals.\n\n\nThroughout the course of treatment, the pump and patient\n\n\nare regularly monitored by a nurse. At specific intervals,\n\n\na patient’s blood pressure and temperature are taken.\n\n\nThe process is not without risk, and common side-effects include\n\ndizziness, migraines, bodily pain, fever, and anxiety.\n\n\n\nDue to the commonness of side-effects\n\n\nduring IVIG treatment, it is crucial that the patient\n\n\nbe carefully monitored for their own safety.\n\n\nThe nurse’s role during the treatment is to\n\n\nuse their knowledge of medicine to actively track the data\n\n\ngenerated by the pump and the patient,\n\n\nas two machines to be monitored, checked on regularly—known to\nmalfunction.\n\n\n\n\nThe nurse’s view of the encounter is necessarily\n\n\ncolored by their medical training, years of practice\n\n\n(or lack thereof),\n\n\nand the relations of power that place\n\n\nthe nurse above the patient\n\n\nin the hierarchy of knowledge,\n\n\nbut always below the specialist doctor\n\n\nwhose signature mandates the prescription.\n\n\n\n\nMedical vernacular narrativizes illness as a fight,\n\n\nas a war to be waged against and within one’s own body.\n\n\nI’ll play along.\n\n\nExpectations during transfusion echo those of combat.\n\n\nWhile the patient is receiving IVIG,\n\n\ninvisible battles are waged at the cellular level,\n\n\ntheir body is receiving a drop shipment of reinforcements.\n\n\nGenerals keep informed by monitoring data.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the soldierly patient is caught in a skirmish\n\n\nwith the side-effects of their body’s shifting\n\n\nchemical (im)balance.\n\n\nVitals are assessed regularly by a nurse on duty,\n\n\nmonitoring the battleground.\n\n\nThe risks for the body are the driving factor\n\n\ndetermining the rhythm of the encounter with IVIG.\n\n\n\n\nBloodiness is a magnetism, an earthiness.\n\n\nObserving my own arms the veins are hills and tunnels.\n\n\nThey bulge and recess in turn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s commonplace for a nurse in a talkative mood\n\n\nto comment upon their quality.\n\n\nExpert appraisal has it: my veins are ripe for needling.\n\n\nNot that any of us are too eager.\n\n\nThey’re working, sticking needles into veins for days on end.\n\n\nSick work, bloody labour.\n\n\nMost nurses are highly skilled at this task.\n\n\nCommendable. It barely hurts.\n\n\n\n\nThe unpredictable nature of IVIG side-effects\n\n\ndemand an awareness of one’s own existence in the world,\n\n\ncoexisting with the machines,\n\n\nthe drugs, and the nurses all around\n\n\nand all implicated in the happening.\n\n\nAt a given moment during the transfusion,\n\n\nthe body might refuse the medication.\n\n\nIn spite of this, the patient is not expected\n\n\nto take an active part in the process.\n\n\nThe body only receives.\n\n\nMuch as plasma donors are invited to ‘relax with free wifi!’,\n\n\nthe patient is asked to sit back, breathe,\n\n\nand allow the requisite time to pass.\n\n\n\n\nBack into human corporeality through a new needle,\n\n\ndown the intravenous drip from the infusion pump\n\n\nand the sterile containers.\n\n\nThe crystalline substance comes into\n\n\nanother biological body at last.\n\n\nNot for the first time, not for the last time,\n\n\nI soak up it all up.\n\n\nFrame a photograph, click, freezing the drip…drip…drip…\n\n\nSitting cannulated, plenty of places I’d rather be,\n\n\nsat in a blue chair within blue walls\n\n\nbleeding red in purple veins\n\n\nwhile crystal clear plasma fractionations\n\n\nmake up the difference.\n\n\n\n\nThe human body and blood-product collide\n\n\nin their inescapable urge to merge,\n\n\nthe global bloodstream’s capillaries meeting in transfusion.\n\n\nFusion, underscoring the loss of discrete identities\n\n\nbetween the concoction and the body,\n\n\nimplies oneness and indissolubility.\n\n\n\n\nPrivigen® soon disappears and turns “Human” again\n\n\nwithin new veins. Co-mingling\n\n\nwith this new host, plasma-cum-Privigen®\n\n\nfinds a body different from the thousands it inhabited\n\n\nin its past lives. Plugged into the infusion pump,\n\n\nthe patient submits their human body\n\n\nto the clinical environment. The assimilation\n\n\nis accompanied by an array of multisensory reactions.\n\n\nThe experience of transfusion confers\n\n\na uniquely embodied knowledge,\n\n\nand the patient’s body must successfully\n\n\nassimilate, or reject the drug.\n\n\n\n\nA needle is a tool,\n\n\nmanufactured to transit blood into the realm of medicine:\n\n\nuse, examination, engineering, processing, alteration.\n\n\nIn opening a vein, the needle has served\n\n\nits utilitarian purpose.\n\n\nAs blood moves through the needle into a world of industry,\n\n\nthe needle comes into being through\n\n\na narrow technoscientific focus.\n\n\nA transitory, ephemeral vessel for blood,\n\n\ndesigned as a single-use object.\n\n\nA sterile puncturing device made of steel,\n\n\nwrapped in plastic,\n\n\nonly useful in conjunction with innumerable\n\n\noperative relations\n\n\nspecific to the bloodstream’s global assemblage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as blood has sufficiently flowed,\n\n\nwithdraw the needle and dispose of it.\n\n\nThrow it away into that specially marked\n\n\nfluorescent-yellow bin: biohazard.\n\n\nSo the needle’s journey continues into trash-heaps\n\n\nand landfills; tubes touched by human blood\n\n\nare too dangerous for recycling.\n\n\n\n\nNothing opens or closes this bloodstream\n\n\nthe flow is uninterrupted, only the map changes.\n\n\nPaths may shift but assemblages, in all their specificities,\n\n\nenact the relations which create words and flesh,\n\n\ndirt and water, none of which are discrete.\n\n\nBlood is the substance of human life,\n\n\nothered by its capture into the industry’s web.\n\n\n\n\nOn this map, the intravenous needle is the site of othering.\n\n\nIn Deleuze and Guattari’s terms,\n\n\nit is the machine which holds the key,\n\n\nthe cutting edge inserting itself into the donor\n\n\n(full of its all-too-fleshy organs, already organ-less,\n\n\nblood-less, mere raw material for sale),\n\n\ndrawing out essence from a single organism\n\n\nto a node within the planetary bloodstream.\n\n\n\n\nIn the acts of needling and blood-draw,\n\n\nblood is uprooted from its origin within the donor’s porous body\n\n\nand seeps into the territories of biotechnology\n\n\nand medical industry.\n\n\nIt becomes plasma.\n\n\n\n\nHydration and medication and nutrition share an entry point,\n\n\na singular superficial vein in the arm\n\n\nor the wrist or the hand.\n\n\n\n\nPrivigen®’s product monograph states that\n\n\n“the recommended initial infusion rate of Privigen® is\n\n\n0.5 mg/kg/min. If well tolerated, the rate of administration\n\n\nmay gradually be increased up to an infusion rate of 12 mg/kg/min.”\n\n\nLet’s pause for some quick math. I weigh approximately 60 kilograms.\n\n\n\n\n60kg x 2g = 120g or 120’000mg.\n\n\nMaximum rate of infusion: 12mg/kg/minute\n\n\n12mg x 60kg = 720mg per minute\n\n\nx 60 minutes = 43200mg per hour\n\n\n120’000mg total divided by 43’200mg/hour = 2.77 hours\n\n\nAt the maximum rate of infusion, the treatment takes just under 3 hours.\n\n\n\n\nNow the minimum: 0.5mg/kg/minute\n\n\n0.5mg x 60kg = 30 mg per minute\n\n\nx 60 minutes = 1800 mg per hour\n\n\n120’000mg total divided by 1800mg/hour = 66.666… hours\n\n\nOr, roughly 67 hours.\n\n\n\n\nSo, IVIG may take me between 3 and 67 hours to receive, per dose.\n\n\nThe reality is somewhere in between, since the rate fluctuates\n\n\nIn my experience, infusion took somewhere between 4-8 hours,\n\n\nwithout taking into account the logistical considerations\n\n\nof other appointments, tests, and the fact of getting to the hospital.\n\n\n\n\nThe bags of fluid hanging over the pump empty out\n\n\nand get replaced many times daily.\n\n\nSometimes they are medicine, sometimes they are\n\n\nsimply to keep the cannula from clogging.\n\n\nPassive, the body becomes a chemical battleground\n\n\nfor armies of vastly different scales while the\n\n\nmind occupies itself with other tasks.\n\n\nUnpredictable details of experience demand an awareness\n\n\nof one’s own existence in the world, collaborating with the machines,\n\n\nthe drugs, and the medical professionals all around\n\n\nand all implicated in the global flow of blood-derived-medicine.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I live transfusion?\n\n\nEach donor gives something essential with their plasma.\n\n\nThere is more than a material transfer of blood proteins happening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 hours after treatment, the migraine hit. Beneath the\ncacophony of pressure pulsing in my skull I hear words, fragments of\nthought, worries and concerns: suicide; hunger; poverty; last resorts.\nTransfusion sends me spiralling through the night sky above Nepal.\nAlive, dancing a transient prayer in trance before a kneeling idol.\nVenus burns above. Lust seethes and bares its teeth, leaving fire trails\nof crimson until control is relinquished willingly. Then each bite tears\naway a part for itself, hungry ravenous flesh but not yours alone. We\nneed variety at this table if we are to dine joyfully. Dust flies with\nstep of the dancer’s bare feet. Communion intensifies and each\nparticipants feels the Arrival of death and love. Spiralling, to make\nknown that this body belongs to them. Please, they ask, allow me to\ngouge out your eyes, to enact the lessons of pain. Gouging must occur\nwithout anaesthetic of amphetamines of the kinds you give your soldiers.\nI’ll keep you isolated in a room with only the minimum necessary\nsustenance, have you reach the ground-state of sobriety. Don’t worry,\nyou’ll survive. I haven’t decided whether to use a fork or a spoon,\nwhich would you prefer? Open your eyes, the nurse tells me, the\ntreatment is over for today. Tell me you miss me. Tell me how our\ndistance is hurting you. Tell me how your skin longs for mine. Tell me\nhow your eyes hunt for mine. Tell me I’m enough of a woman for you. Tell\nme my anger is okay. Tell me you understand. Tell me my fear you love me\nless is unfounded. Stop telling me about other people, you’re the only\none that matters. Tell me your heart hurts too. Show me, rip out your\nsternum and tear apart your thorax and show me. Burning in my chest, our\ndistance subsides to hollowness when the fire dwindles. I wish I could\nscream and wail and break my mirror and immolate my bones if only to\nmake the feeling dissipate if only to make you go away if only if only\nif only it could turn to warm sadness I try to follow to its source that\nturns to rage again. Frustration. Would that I could rip out my valvular\npump and hold it up to my cornea, if looking is truly the most effective\nway to Know. Broad daylight, sun pierces through the canopy of broadleaf\ndeciduous life. A harsh metal scrape and the tearing of wood. Push,\npull, push, pull. A human-powered deforestation, saw in hand.\nMechanically we chant to keep the cadence, but I do not hear my own\nvoice. The tree interpellates me. What are we doing? Why take by\nmetallic force instead of asking for help? Don’t we know that our\nlarghissimo elders, the birches, the cedars, the maples, are ready to\nfall on their own if we speak the right words? But I do not heed this\ntrain of thought. The saw shakes in my grip and the tree is finally\nfelled. Would that I could freeze time and devote endless life to\nunderstanding pain’s anatomy. This pain is not my longing for you,\nthough my longing is there subsumed. This pain is bigger than I am, and\nnarrow as a platinum razor’s edge. A pickaxe in hand. Heavy beneath an\nempty stomach I dig at the grave I will inhabit soon enough. I do not\nknow when the end arrives. I ask myself whether my grandfather was right\nto fear death. At least I will get to stop digging. Nearby, a young man,\nyounger than me, grey with fatigue, falls. I await the inevitable order:\nOi! Heb das auf, stapel es mit den anderen. I do not complain, merely\ncomply, do not meet the soldier’s eyes. They lead nowhere I wish to go.\nHier la transfusion m’emmena à Kathmandou, il y a 12 générations.\nL’ancêtre sanguin se fit connaître. Je danse en prière devant une\ncroupissante idole. Vénus brûle au-dessus de moi, et je danse. Un cercle\nfiévreux se forme au rythme de mon corps. La poussière virevolte à\nchaque pas que prennent mes agiles pieds nus. La communion s’intensifie,\net tous nous ressentons l’Arrivée d’une déesse de l’amour et de la mort.\nJe tourbillonne, je dois être à sa hauteur, lui faire savoir que mon\ncorps est sien, qu’elle n’a qu’à me prendre dans ses bras. These words\nare neither me nor not me, not any more or less than the ten thousand\nsouls that inhabit me. The words: the plasma of thousands within my\nveins. Unknowable, yet pained. It is a matter of soul. Too much, too\nmany. Pressure builds. Only so much can be processed at once. Clogged up\nwith so many essences. The first 16 hours are the most revelatory. I\nknow during that period just how alive the plasma remains, dripping from\nthe flask. My blood is aflame, I run a fever. The first time I stood up,\nI thought perhaps a lifetime had gone. Every step riddled with latency,\nraising a thermometer takes eons. My vision is blurry, noisy. Each\ntwitch of a muscle clatters. Standing is akin to shattering a mountain.\nI find myself praying. First to Abraham’s God. Then Michaël, Raphaël.\nThen my grandparents. Then I beseech those souls directly coursing in my\nveins. I address them, plead for respite. Despite being of the blood,\nthey remember little of the pain of flesh. So it was that my body\nrecognized them, and did all in its power to remember suffering on their\nbehalf. The following night I dream long, beautiful dreams full of\nlonging. For place, for company, for shared meals. We argue\nwarmheartedly over what to get at the store. I float through the\nstoreroom. It was dark except for the flood of street-lamps through\nmakeshift curtains and we both scream ecstasy. Rolling over once the\nhigh leaves my muscles, touch reverts to terror. How many times did I\npush them away when I wished to hold us close? The weight of their body\nfelt crushing upon arms chest gut—any pressure brought a flood of fear.\nWhat if arteries pop veins rip flow ceases? My lover’s head resting upon\nmy chest brings it all back, the irrational bleeding mind, assailed by\nbodily doubt, harrowing anxieties.\nMemories of dark purple bulbs, protrusions and all any of us know of\nthem is bleeding. On a long bus ride, a friendship is forged in\nphilosophy, a bond of lovers. Ecstasy again awakens me and I find the\nmigraine mostly gone. So IVIG induced an experience of the sublime. It\nmight be an entheogen. One body is no proper container for thousands.\n\n\n\nHiromu Arakawa’s Fullmetal Alchemist\n\n\nis worth its weight in salt, sheer joy\n\n\nat the honest love and hate of characters at grips with truth.\n\n\nIf anyone wants to understand the experience of IVIG\n\n\nthey should try to understand Ed and Alphonse’s dad, Van Hohenheim.\n\n\n\n\nThe process of transfusion is one by which medicine\n\n\nturns Privigen® “human” again and creates\n\n\na homunculus of my body.\n\n\nEvery single donor\n\n\nis my ancestor,\n\n\nis my body,\n\n\nis me.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been discussing the experiences of\n\n\ndonating plasma and receiving transfusions.\n\n\nWhile I am critical of the corporate practices\n\n\nwith which these are intertwined,\n\n\nI am not here to disparage the act of donating blood or plasma.\n\n\nI acknowledge that the scores of people who donate,\n\n\ncompensated or otherwise,\n\n\nare giving a gift to large swaths of the population.\n\n\nI am perhaps alive because of you.\n\n\nGiving blood facilitates life-saving medicine\n\n\non a daily basis.\n\n\nThe individuals involved in the blood economy\n\n\nare engaging in essential actions\n\n\nfor those of us whose bodies\n\n\nrequire regular or emergency assistance.\n\n\n\n\nThe fault does not reside within donation or transfusion.\n\n\nThese are simply material realities of medical practice.\n\n\nThe problem lies outside the classical frame of healthcare,\n\n\nwhere capital interests muddy the waters\n\n\nand turn healing into exploitation.\n\n\n\n\nMy goal is to offer another narrative,\n\n\none that runs parallel to that offered\n\n\nblood donors and the public,\n\n\nand in so doing, to shift perspective away\n\n\nfrom dominant discourses of Health.\n\n\nThe healthcare system has a dual purpose:\n\n\nit aims to rehabilitate sick people\n\n\nso that they can get back to work,\n\n\nand to maintain a relationship with the\n\n\nmedico-technical and pharmaceutical industries.\n\n\n\n\nIn doing so, the healthcare system acts\n\n\nas the distribution centre of the medical-industrial\n\n\ncomplex, simultaneously extracting money\n\n\nfrom individuals and governments\n\n\nfor the benefit of corporations,\n\n\nall the while “curing” people of their ills\n\n\nso that they may return to producing surplus value.\n\n\n\n\nPlasma Collection Centres choose to call\n\n\nthe sale of raw bodily material a donation,\n\n\nlinking it to the gift relationship with which people\n\n\nengage for no monetary compensation.\n\n\nThe rhetoric reveals the industry’s desire\n\n\nto appear as a benefactor,\n\n\nas falling in line with the purported\n\n\nmoral values of Healthcare.\n\n\nI suggest we call these places Extraction Centres,\n\n\nto be honest about the dividends demanded\n\n\nfrom processing raw material.\n\n\nYet the firms do not market themselves\n\n\nas extracting surplus value\n\n\nfrom the bodies of their “donors.”\n\n\n\n\nLet’s reorient perception of these companies\n\n\nas driven by profit,\n\n\nthus opening them up to a certain critique.\n\n\nBy aligning themselves with Healthcare,\n\n\na plasma extraction firm renders its operating strategy opaque.\n\n\nAccording to the rhetoric employed,\n\n\nthe system in place grants “donors” the privilege of doing good work.\n\n\nTechnoscientific capitalism would have its subjects believe that\n\n\nit is not at fault for making it necessary that low-income individuals\n\n\nsupplement their bottom-line by selling plasma.\n\n\nThe onus of choice is apparently placed on the individuals “donating,”\n\n\nbut many living in precarity have no other remaining options\n\n\nbut to sell their own flesh.\n\n\nThe moral sledgehammer falls heavy.\n\n\nMake cash, save lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican human-hours in the form of blood\n\n\ntrickle downwards through the global medical-industrial complex.\n\n\nOpposite the upward flow of taxpayer dollars\n\n\nin public healthcare systems buying plasma-derived drugs\n\n\n\n\nIn extracting plasma for profit, corporations are\n\n\ncontinually alienating poor working class people from their own bodies.\n\n\nOn the receiving end, the opaque nature of medicine works to pacify\n\n\nthe patients whose lives depend on an indefinite supply of transfusions,\n\n\nand what is taken from the ill person is\n\n\ntheir urgent need to struggle for change.\n\n\nIn the end, patients rarely protest against\n\n\nthe destructive and exploitative nature of healthcare.\n\n\nDonation and transfusion are counterparts,\n\n\nconcentrating human hours at opposite ends of the process,\n\n\noperating in clinical environments on opposing subjects.\n\n\n\n\nThe seemingly solitary experience of transfusion\n\n\nis an illusion\n\n\nshattered by acknowledging that Privigen®\n\n\ndeposits thousands of unknowable donors within my bloodstream.\n\n\nThe extraction of plasma is already an act of alienation,\n\n\nsplitting apart the components of human blood\n\n\nto harvest only that which is profitable.\n\n\nThe bodies at play are agents charged with their own histories,\n\n\nbut a patient is not necessarily aware of the systemic violence\n\n\nand ongoing oppressions which create\n\n\nthe global bloodstream as an industry.\n\n\n\n\nPatients whose wellbeing depends on\n\n\nan indefinite supply of plasma\n\n\nare often in the privileged position\n\n\nof being able not to ask too many questions\n\n\nabout the functioning of the system\n\n\nkeeping their symptoms at bay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obfuscation of knowledge, the withholding,\n\n\nmay be crucial\n\n\nto the operation of the healthcare industry.\n\n\n\n\nIf all the histories that charge Privigen® were known,\n\n\npeople might refuse treatment, hurt profits.\n\n\n\n\nThe dilemma runs deep: what’s more important,\n\n\nmy own health, or that of 15000 impoverished “donors”?\n\n\n\n\nThat knowledge may also be too much,\n\n\nfor how can one body bear the violence\n\n\nenacted upon thousands?\n\n\n\n\nBy taking an interest in transfusion,\n\n\nand acknowledging the relationships\n\n\nthat are formed during the process,\n\n\na body regains agency,\n\n\nand becomes a source of gnosis.\n\n\n\n\nI was taught that my biology is not to be trusted.\n\n\nThe chemical decisions enacted in my\n\n\nbloodstream were the enemy.\n\n\n\n\nThe language used by doctors to describe auto-immunity\n\n\nmakes it seem like there a civil war raging,\n\n\nand the combatants are confused, engaging friendly-fire.\n\n\n\n\nBut that’s not what’s going on.\n\n\nAuto-immunity is a recalibration, a warning.\n\n\nA call to change habits, to listen closely to the invisible.\n\n\nHealing does not come from microscopes and pharmacology.\n\n\nThe way out of autoimmunity is the composition of a new body.\n\n\n\n\nIs there any truth to the proposition\n\n\nthat all our cells change every 7 years?\n\n\n\n\nMy body is a set of relationships\n\n\nbetween the visible and the invisible.\n\n\nA concerted effort has been sustained to render\n\n\never more of it visible through imaging technologies.\n\n\nBut what about the other senses?\n\n\nWhat about the corpuscles dedicated to sensing\n\n\nchemical balance in the bloodstream?\n\n\nWhat if those could be brought to individual awareness?\n\n\nI say they can.\n\n\n\n\nMy cure is not medicine, it is knowledge becoming love.\n\n\nKnowledge of my archive, of cell biology, of spiritual science, of\nquantum physics, of imperial histories, of medical politics, of\nsettler-colonial genealogies, magic, and my own soul.\n\n\nIntegrated experiences of medical trauma,\n\n\nloving kindness,\n\n\ndisillusionment.\n\n\nA will to trust in my own body’s capacity to heal\n\n\nto move into another version of self,\n\n\none in which the pharmacy does not\n\n\ndictate my realm of possibilities.\n\n\nA will to devote myself to myself each and every day,\n\n\nto learn how enmeshed my chemistry is with yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSickness in Limbo\n\n\n\n\nThrough the nascent storm, walk away from the river.\n\nIt’s my first winter near my grandfather’s grave,\n\n\non occupied territory first named Gespe’gewa’gi,\n\n\nseventh district of Mi’gma’gi,\n\n\nthe ancestral and unceeded territory of the Mi’gmaq,\n\n\nlater christened Sainte-Anne-Des-Monts by my ancestors.\n\n\nSeven-thousand inhabitants nestled\n\n\nalong the south bank of the St-Lawrence\n\n\n49° North.\n\n\nHere, on a clear day I can see the northern shoreline.\n\n\nHere, I’ve learned that the wind is a fickle dance partner.\n\n\nFrom the occulted beach, turn south.\n\n\nPace a side street amid bluster, foot after foot uphill in the\nsnowdrifts,\n\n\ntowards the CLSC perched above town.\n\n\nA reception clerk notifies the nurse of my arrival.\n\n\nI sit in the waiting room.\n\n\nI’m the only patient at first, but others soon arrive.\n\n\n\n\nToday is March 5th, 2021, and I am still healing.\n\n\nI await results, self-reparation.\n\n\nWhat does the blood have to say, today?\n\n\nI am repentant in the face of medicine,\n\n\nI’ve come back after voluntary cessation of treatment.\n\n\nI considered the immediate alternatives\n\n\nand found the pharmakon I know will at least mitigate symptoms,\n\n\nif never cure.\n\n\n\n\nMy intestines weep red and I wipe away tears alongside feces.\n\n\nNow is not the time to gamble.\n\n\nPatiently sit in a black plastic chair supported by a stainless-steel\nframe,\n\n\nseparate from the others visible through plexiglass bolted to the wall.\n\n\nPostered on the wall there’s a PSA about STI tests,\n\n\na showcase of lovers in ecstatic touch.\n\n\nMatthieu-Xavier’s name is called.\n\n\nI pull my gaze away from the illustrated longing\n\n\nand towards an old nurse named Thomas.\n\n\nHe’s cheerful, deftly handles the needle.\n\n\nHis steady hands are the only human touch I feel each week.\n\n\nWe talk about the weather as he draws blood.\n\n\nThis winter, so he says, “has been exceptional, truly.\n\n\nExceptionally warm, and brief, and bereft of snow.\n\n\nTrust me, this is nothing.”\n\n\n\n\nBefore the time of remote friendships, in a limbo reserved for the sick,\n\n\nI’m comforted by broken bread shared with others\n\ncaught in their own ouroboros.\n\nEach chronically healing body differs in its minutiae,\n\n\nyet sickness breeds a hearth around which to gather and keep warm.\n\n\nI reach out towards the fire, grateful for company that is not charity.\n\n\nGrateful for those whose “I’m sorry” is not pity.\n\n\nThere is no pretence, no brave faces.\n\n\nNo imperative to cater to the comfort\n\n\nof those who believe they are forever healthy.\n\n\nI wager that for the sick, those who know that healing is cyclical,\n\n\na pandemic’s disruption of time may have felt familiar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pandemic has shown me that\n\n\ndiscussions of illness are no longer concerned with\n\n\nthe need to convince or remind the healthy that their certainty,\n\n\nthe self-assured confidence of perpetual health, is illusory.\n\n\nThe news media has done a thorough job of\n\n\ninstilling fear, breeding anxiety, and perpetuating\n\n\nthe poisonous narrative that is the hero’s journey.\n\n\nFrom healthy,\n\n\nto sick, soon to be healthy again,\n\n\ndisease must be overcome.\n\n\nIllness must be overcome.\n\n\nSo goes the story.\n\n\nThe calendar lies in tatters at my feet,\n\n\ntorn pages unstitched as despair and hope\n\n\nenmesh in a spiral dance, a whirlwind\n\n\nshreds my abdomen while delirium burns around me,\n\n\nfear succeeds joy and, impatient to get a move on,\n\n\nI dream of spring.\n\n\nHow long is a year, then?\n\n\nAmidst a turmoil of organs, unsettled feuds remain.\n\n\n\n\nNeedled for a thousand blood draws,\n\n\nI’ve come to reject the fiction of illness.\n\n\nThe global immune response to crisis\n\n\nthrows into sharp relief that healing is a learned skill.\n\n\nThere is no plotted course, no long-term plans,\n\n\nbut illness is not the only story,\n\n\nand I devise strategies for a sick life.\n\n\nI remind myself that healing goes on in illness,\n\n\nthat there is no miraculous cure-all.\n\n\nInner awareness, rest, and time off\n\n\nare necessary tools for survival.\n\n\n\n\nI am responsible for my own touch-starved self\n\n\nand those few with whom I conspire.\n\n\nI strive to tune into the resonance\n\n\nby which I may make my way my own.\n\n\nIt begins when I listen to the flesh.\n\n\nThen, breathe with the world and find myself\n\n\nat home within the web of ongoing creation.\n\n\nStand still by the estuary\n\n\nbefore the mouth of the river Sainte-Anne\n\n\nas it pours into the St-Lawrence.\n\n\nIce shatters, sends waves up my spine,\n\n\nand I know that the invisible flows\n\n\nbeneath the rustle of snow\n\n\nare the same movements felt in my veins\n\n\nand heard in the cracks of the ice.\n\n\nWarmed by the sun under the vertiginous turquoise sky,\n\n\nI give thanks for the chance to live such beauty\n\n\nanother day, another night.\n\n\nCOVID-19 will “end.” The news cycles and feeds will move on.\n\n\nWhat then? Will the transience of the body itself\n\n\nhave gained any respect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring turns to summer\n\n\nsolar rays are talismanic but no protection\n\n\nagainst the biting flies.\n\n\nIt is July 2021.\n\n\nDeep in the forests of the Bas-Saint-Laurent,\n\n\nstiff limbs shed fatigue as they awaken to use.\n\n\nMonths go by without a blood test.\n\n\nHands learn to craft metal and till the dirt.\n\n\nI spend a week reworking a tin crucifix\n\n\ninto a solar necklace.\n\n\nRip Jesus off his cross.\n\n\nRend the soft metal into a new shape\n\n\nand sand away decades of rust.\n\n\nBy the time I’m done it’s a triangular pendant\n\n\nwith a soft gold sheen.\n\n\nI give it to my grandmother,\n\n\nthe first piece of jewelry I ever made.\n\n\n\n\nBlack flies are unavoidable but plantain leaf\n\nmakes an effective poultice.\n\nI learn to walk, tread through the fields\n\nof foxtail and couch-grass,\nattuned to the pollinators whose hum guides my step.\n\nHealing is of the dirt and water, my breath, my bones.\n\n\nHealing is the love I hold for my body’s proteins.\n\nIts ligatures, its fats, sugars, spinal liquidity,\nand all the microbes with whom I share these cells.\n\nHealing is that peculiar sensation in the optic nerve\n\nconfronted with sublimity,\nan old growth forest or an open sky.\n\nThe muscular jouissance of a footstep.\n\n\nSickness is in the chemical agonists at work on my spine’s marrow.\n\n\nSickness is the rigidity of my fascia.\n\nI have so much to learn of healing from the trees,\nthe birds, the frogs.\nThe creak of limbs 50 feet above me,\nthe withering bark, the barren branches.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutumn, the black tar spot on fallen maple leaves,\n\n\nthe first scent of snow. The murder croaks at dawn.\n\n\nThe black birds are telling me to pray, to notice the decay.\n\n\n\n\nBattered by winter, it is unclear\n\n\nwhether fatigue is physical or existential.\n\n\nOr it is both.\n\n\nI am an aquifer, from which Thomas’ needle\n\nextracts groundwater.\n\nInto the vial my blood flows,\n\n\nexamined for deficiency to track my risk of bleeding.\n\n\nBut sickness extends beyond the blood\n\n\nit will not be contained by any such essentializing.\n\n\nI am tackling the problem of healing in the long term.\n\n\nSickness, lived not as something to cure,\n\n\nescape, climb out of, but as a maze\n\n\nfrom which there is no exit, no future.\n\n\nHealing is a labyrinth: it is the snake eating its tail.\n\n\nHealing is acknowledging that Akeso\n\n\nis too the daughter of Asclepius.\n\n\nTreating such complexities with words,\n\n\nin an attempt to cure pathology\n\n\naccording to numbers on a chart,\n\n\nall this is too abstract.\n\n\nHealing is anything but theory.\n\n\nWithout the imperative to strive\n\n\nfor a mythical life free from illness,\n\n\na sick existence breeds wondrous possibility.\n\n\nI am armed with fresh clay through which I mold my body;\n\n\nreams of blank paper upon which to compose symphonies.\n\n\nThe possibilities are not so remote. I choose to live\n\n\nnow the universal flourishing of an eternal recurring eden.\n\n\nI am not in a circle of hell,\n\n\nbut a quiet place, a simple place.\n\n\nNot the void, but somewhere to gather\n\n\nand sing songs.\n\n\n\n\nThomas withdraws the needle,\n\n\naffixes a small bandage to the leaky prick,\n\n\nsecures it with plastic medical tape.\n\n\nI will wash off the gummy residue for three days.\n\n\nI thank him and say, “see you next week.”\n\n\nBack outside, the blizzard has thickened.\n\n\nAcross the hospital parking lot,\n\n\nI can’t see the water in the distance.\n\n\nI glean the outline of an oversized,\n\n\nwhite-painted wooden cross planted at the cliff’s edge.\n\n\nOn a clear day the visibility stretches for miles,\n\n\nrounding the horizon.\n\n\nSo, I’m back to the walk, foot after foot,\n\n\ndown towards the river, north,\n\n\ndown the same path I followed up,\n\n\narm cradled to staunch the pinpoint wound,\n\n\ncurious whether today it will leave a bruise.\n\n\n\n\nI do not refuse sickness,\n\n\nI do not refuse the ongoing collapse\n\n\nof so much I took for granted.\n\n\nI strive for love in limbo and accept\n\n\nthat which I cannot control,\n\n\nto better make meaning\n\n\nfrom those minuscule decisions that shape each day.\n\n\nI am doing things, moving by stillness.\n\n\nI do all I can. The best with what is, right now.\n\n\nThe answers come only with time, unbidden, like old friends.\n\n\nNo right, no wrong. I am still healing.\n\n\nI still take pills and attempt to make sense\n\n\nof this body’s enigma.\n\n\nI know I am not alone in this, even if isolated in the cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Spring Spent Nannying\n\n\n\n\nI left home to the tune of Daydream Nation.\nShe said: I wanted to map the exact dimensions of hell.\nDoes this sound simple?\nMay 8th\n“We’re all gonna die!

The transience of the body itself is holy.\n\n\n2. Auto-immunity is self-defence, multifarious resistance, radical\npermeability, touchability.\n\n\n3. Auto-immunity demands surrender, re-evaluation of what makes you\nhuman, what makes you you.\n\n\n4. There is no such thing as health.\n\n\n5. Auto-immunity shatters the telos upon shores of blood, treatment of\nsymptoms agonizes the root cause.\n\n\n6. Auto-immunity is not an illness, it is endowment with strength,\npower, knowledge\n\n\n7. Auto-immunity is self-knowledge, a map, responsibility.\n\n\n8. Through auto-immunity, universal entanglements reverberate in felt\nsense.\n\n\n9. Auto-immunity is not a curse, it is the wise wound within the body.\n\n\n10. I would rather be sick and cunning than healthy and dull.\n\n\n11. If I am sick, the land is sick.\n\n\n12. Auto-immunity is the body in revolt against global poisoning.\n\n\n13. Auto-immunity transcends identity.\n\n\n14. Culture is auto-immune.\n\n\n15. Auto-immunity diffracts the body’s holistic context.\n\n\n16. You can be auto-immune without conscious acceptance. Soon enough,\nyour body will tell you.\n\n\n17. Auto-immunity is a form of mourning; the body grieving worldly\ncruelty.\n\n\n18. Auto-immunity is a call to listen.\n\n\n19. Auto-immunity is inexorable change.\n\n\n20. Auto-immunity is embodied heresy.\n\n\n21. Auto-immunity is both constructive and destructive interference.\n\n\n22. Auto-immunity is necessarily solitary, but you are not alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asceticism\n\n\n\n\nWhat do I need? \nEnough food, a safe shelter, people with whom to share my life.\nAsceticism is about claiming the power to refuse.\nThe etymology has been traced to the 17th century,\nfrom Medieval Latin asceticus,\nfrom Ancient Greek ἀσκητικός (askētikós),\nfrom ἀσκητής (askētḗs, “monk, hermit”),\nfrom ἀσκέω (askéō, “I exercise”).\nThere’s the french word acèse, asceticism, abstention.\nThe god/dess of asceticism is Akeso,\ndaughter of Asclepius, the Physician of the gods.\nAkeso is honest. Akeso is an alchemist. Akeso is temperance.\nSometimes harsh, sometimes gentle.\nAlways attuned to the needs of healing.\nThey do not heal so much as guide\nthe sick towards convalescence,\nregeneration, re(in)storing their own capacity for recuperation.\nFrom Ancient Greek Ἀκεσώ (Akesṓ).\nIn Portuguese, Galician, Italian, related to:\n(transitive) to light, set alight, ignite, kindle\n(transitive) to turn on (a device)\n(transitive, figuratively) to fire up\n\n\nSo I read here a relation to training, practice,\nan ongoing effort to deepen devotion and commitment.\nThe ascetic is traditionally a lone practitioner,\nmore closely related with the hermit\nthan the communal monastic (french: cénobite).\nThe ascetic need not preach, or attempt to convert others to their\ncause.\nThe definitions of asceticism I’ve found\ncommonly point towards either a moral practice or an artistic practice.\nI am more aligned with ascesis as an art.\nThis is not a moral undertaking.\nRather, it is a response to global poisoning,\nand a way to claim personal well-being,\nindividual action, pure negation.\nMaking space for something else.\nMy nascent asceticism acknowledges\nthat “the world” will not be saved,\nthat no saviour exists outside myself,\nthat supply chain collapse is ongoing,\nthat consumption wreaks havoc upon personal autonomy.\nThe practice involves learning to discern need from want,\nsensing when want is an external imposition,\nand refusing all that does not serve Life.\nIf, as Mircea Eliade suggests,\nthe sacred is defined spatially,\ncomes into being through delimitation,\nexists as the exceptional place (Foucault’s heterotopia),\nthen the Sacred is a standpoint to adopt,\na place from which to survey the wasteland,\nand a devotee’s habit to don as sheer refusal.\nRefusal to engage with the profane,\nrefusal to inhabit the culture that continues to wreak havoc,\nrefusal to consume its commodities.\nRare is tuberculosis, yet how many still die consumptive?\n\n\nLiving a sacred life necessarily means acknowledging divinity;\nnot as god-almighty-on-high, merely as that-which-is.\nFor now, suffice to say divinity exists as an experience.\nThe metaphors for its facade are numerous.\nKeep the practice joyful,\nmake room for physical pleasure,\nsensuousness, salaciousness.\nRefuse to imbibe the pornographer’s easy meals.\nRefuse the ready-to-think.\nRefuse the pre-fabricated desires.\nAbstain from cherry-picked realms of possibility.\nAsceticism is the study of Life.\nIt is a syncretic approach,\nmeaning it takes what works from anywhere,\nand refuses nonsense from anywhere.\nIn practice, the ascetic hones their sense of discernment,\ntheir sensitivity, their bullshit detectors.\nThis is, ultimately, a game to play.\nInward, the search begins.\nThe search for that which is not spoken of.\nBut for whom is initiation an option in the first place?\nAnd where, now, is the line between the speakable and the unspeakable?\nAny wisdom gained will only be the wisdom of a dying civilization.\nPray to the old and new gods.\nWorship in whatever way makes sense to you,\nand do not expect your rites to make sense to your children.\nRites and ceremonies are potent tools.\nFrom such movements arises gnosis,\ndeeply affecting practitioners and,\nif devotion is sincere, changing the core of orientation to Life.\nRitual holds the power to transform one’s own world,\nand learn about the shared realities.\nCeremony alone, however, is hollow.\nIt is needfully directed by conscious control of the individual,\notherwise known as will, intent, attention, focus.\nWithout focus, ceremony is void of potency.\nSome things are certain:\nhonestly performing established scripts leads to results,\nand the results can profoundly alter experience.\nMagic is a metaphor,\nuseful for making individual sense of patterns\nthat are too big to hold in the conscious mind.\nIt is an orientation device for mentation,\nand useful for someone\nwho feels called to power for its own sake.\nBut why bother?\nAn ascetic approach acknowledges the ongoing process.\nI inhabit the world of my own making,\nwhile factors which I do not consciously hold in mind\ncontinue to affect actions/decisions/options.\nThe theory is meaningless on its own.\nStudy for its own sake is navel-gazing.\nOverloading intellect with big words\nin the hope of spontaneously getting it leads nowhere,\nnot even disillusion. It is necessary to experiment, and to fail.\nWhatever feels intuitive is a clue.\nWhatever poses challenges but keeps interest is another.\nThere is much less to learn from other people than expected.\nAuto-didactics are a key factor.\nDesire is another. I want learning.\nI want transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmnia mutantur\n\n\n\n\nYour body is looking \n\nfor something for\n\n\nitself for it’s of concern\n\n\nto feel here your body’s situation\n\n\nits (in)finitude.\n\n\n\n\nYour body is trillions of microbes\n\n\nbillions of years in the making\n\n\ndestructive antibiotic abuse\n\n\nmicroplastic, disintegrating commodities\n\n\nalchemizing from fossil fragments,\n\n\ndeposits of Gaia’s deep-time digestion\n\n\nwreaking havoc upon microbiota\n\n\naccumulated in the Pacific ocean\n\n\ngarbage patch;

I was looking for answers,\nhaving not yet learned that, at best,\nI can merely refine my questions.\nAt the time, it felt like something profound ought to come from agony.\nBut perhaps it is the banality, the ultimate meaninglessness of\nside-effects\nthat is revealed here. What right have I to claim some importance,\nto ascribe meaning to the everyday? Remember this: we all suffer.\n\n\n\nThe meaning is not in the suffering itself.\n\nHow could I possibly justify painkillers if it were?\nIs sense experience inherently meaningful?\n\nIs anaesthesia, then, a poison, chilling the soul\n\nas well as the body?\n\nOught I have let the migraine run its course\n\nwithout those little tylenol pills?\n\nWhat experience or insight did I deprive myself of\n\nby choosing to minimize pain?\n\nIs this line of questioning merely playing\n\ninto a masochist hero’s narrative?\n\nOr a fantasy of the tortured mystic?\n\n\nAnother question in progress:\n\n\nHow do the pharmaco-kinetics of intravenous blood products\n\n\naffect bio-spiritually intra-acting bodies?\n\n\nSimple: I do not know.\n\n\n\n\nIn the midst of pandemic,\n\n\nI shed many of my preconceived notions\n\n\nI had long held about my own reality.\n\n\nI was (and am) giving serious consideration\n\n\nto the aspects of my experience\n\n\nthat I could not fit into a materialist framework.\n\n\n\n\nI dove, alone, ever deeper into myself,\n\n\naway from as much of the noise as I could,\n\n\nand found faith in the existence of divinity on earth.\n\n\n\n\nI found that even as I critically examine\n\n\nthe claims of charlatans\n\n\nand continue to reject their postural pretences,\n\n\ntheir false certainties, their easy assurances,\n\n\nthere is an intangible, indefinite, inner resonance\n\n\nto the notion that this human body\n\n\nis a direct conduit for my experience of god.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know now that healing is a series of definite mechanisms\n\n\nharnessing the body’s innate capacity for adaptation.\n\n\nMy path is aligned with the middle way, the way of the heart.\n\n\nI am neither shunning my embodied state,\n\n\nnor am I attached to it as a stable, unshifting identity.\n\n\nWithout striving towards any spiritual goal,\n\n\nI remain aware of the continual tension between edifice and dissolution.\n\n\n\n\nI practice in order to neither hold on to my biographical history\n\n\nas the sole source of my identity, nor relinquish\n\n\nthe potential for transformation that inheres\n\n\nto the condition of being alive as a human being.\n\n\n\n\nJouissance is an aspect of the art of getting lost.\n\n\nCreative forgetfulness is part of the way.\n\n\nInternal alchemy is the process of consciously rearranging one’s inner\nbeing.\n\n\n\n\nI am not enlightened, nor is it true that I know nothing at all.\n\n\nI am slowly knowing myself, and I know what I’ve learned,\n\n\nwhat I’ve experienced. I know some of what I do not know.\n\n\nI am not merely an empty vessel for divinity,\n\n\nbut a collaborator with the universal forces.\n\n\nBeing me is a worthwhile endeavour in and of itself,\n\n\nand so is noting the patterns that have calcified\n\n\nover the course of my life so far.\n\n\n\n\nThe river thaws, its flows inexorable.\n\n\nI practice lovingkindness for the land itself,\n\n\nthe boulders in Rivière-Du-Loup’s Parc Des Chutes, the moss.\n\n\nMay they be at peace, free from suffering.\n\n\nHollow human words for a stone,\n\n\nyet the resonance from the heart center is true, real.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the land need?\n\n\nTime, which it has.\n\n\nLove, presence, acknowledgement.\n\n\nThe dirt is not alone, I am here.\n\n\nWe are here, those of us who are awake\n\n\nwith compassion for the web of life.\n\n\n\n\nHold the bodies close together\n\n\nand find they resolve into\n\n\ndissolution, disillusion.

My heart knows that\nreliving these events won’t be easy for me, and would almost rather keep\nsilent, not bother sharing. With the encouragement and support of many\nfriends, I take a step forward, and begin.\n\n\nIt was 2001, high summer near the Salish Sea of Turtle Island’s Pacific\nnorthwest. So-called Vancouver, British Columbia. I was 5 years old.\nLife was a series of forest adventures, pre-school friendships, and\ncreative curiosities held warmly by my single mother’s devotion to\nraising a child alone in her 40s. Being from colonized Gespe’gewa’gi on\nthe opposite ocean’s shore, she had made home in Vancouver during an\nearly adulthood spent traveling the world, fuelled by pure curiosity.\nShe was ready to have a child. Though her lover decided he couldn’t be a\nfather, she chose to become a mother.\n\n\nSurrounded by friends, she brought me into a world full of infinite\npossibility. She recounted myths and fed my love of story. We laughed to\nthe point of tears as she read me kid-friendly renditions of the\njudeo-christian tradition; we imagined a world of justice and love, as\nshe nourished us both with tales of equality and ecology—new myths for\na changing planet.\n\n\nI remember the story of a young princess, dark of skin, who ventures\ninto the enchanted forest. She gets lost, lost in her fear of the woods,\nfear she received from her father. So the guardians of the ancient\ngroves, a dragon and a unicorn, show her how the forest is a place of\nbeauty. When the princess returns home, she shows her father, and he\nrecognizes his daughter’s wisdom. He changes his ways. He stops\ndestroying the forest.\n\n\nI grew up feeling like the forest held all the world’s magic, all its\nwisdom. I knew this to be the truth. My home was an environment in which\nthis ecstatic curiosity and passion for the world, its arts, its\nstories, could flourish.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many things my mother did not know, but she transmitted the\npieces that mattered. She underscored that in all the stories, and in\nall our relations, the uniting, healing force, the bridge across enmity\nand the conflictual sense of separateness, is love. As she shared the\nstories of Adam, Abraham, Moses, she did not have the biting historical\ncomparative-mythology political-philosophy gender-studies critique I\nwould develop two decades later, when I went back to the scripture. Her\nlove of God was as simple and as pure as her love of a child she named\nMatthieu-Xavier Marin. After the apostle, whose name she made a point of\ntelling me means “gift from god”—and her own father, François-Xavier, a\nGaspésien through-and-through, a heavy machinery mechanic whose career\nwas spent in Murdochville’s copper mine.\n\n\nIt was 2001, and I was 5 years old. Summer was coming to a head, the\ntemperate rainforest soaked up the sun’s rays. My days were filled with\nplay, with harmless games. One of those days, my friend and I were\nbrought to a seaside market gift-shop. My memories of Vancouver’s\nmarkets are fond. I remember the smell of salt on the air, the smoked\nsalmon, the honey candies. I remember the seagulls arguing over the\nleftover fries from the fish n’ chips stalls. I can still taste the\nmango sorbet.\n\n\n\n\nThis story begins by accident.\n\n\n“We can’t treat this,”\n\n\ntold us the walk-in clinic attendant,\n\n\n“go to the hospital.”\n\n\nAnd so we did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions For A Blood Doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere once was a boy.\n\nNo, that’s not quite the word.\n\n\n\n\nThere once was a pussy willow lounging in the reeds\n\n\nwith nowhere to call but home\n\n\nwhen the days ran out of tune\n\n\nlike the great-grandfather’s marine band harp,\n\n\nrusty with a half-century’s dis-use,\n\n\nstill sounded crystal clear carrion call\n\n\non the neatly tended forest path\n\n\nwide, and cleared by hundreds of feet each day.\n\n\n\n\nAt a glance no wilds remain here.\n\n\nSo she buys a new harmonica\n\n\nthe same model, tuned to G\n\n\nIt don’t sound the same.\n\n\nWithin a day the 3rd reed broke\n\n\n(won’t play on the inhale)\n\n\nbut she don’t give up because\n\n\nthe harp’s got something to teach\n\n\nher diaphragm about waking up to use,\n\n\nwhat’s more it seems like a neat campfire\n\n\nside doodad to pluck from a pocket\n\n\nwhen the time is ripe.\n\n\n\n\nAlways thinking about how to gather\n\n\naround the fire, now that I’ve had\n\n\na taste again. Israel was\n\n\nthe man’s name, we spoke for hours\n\n\nletting our tongues weave new\n\n\nold folklore for the current apocalypse,\n\n\nstories tuned to the beat of the tongue-drum\n\n\nwith only beauty and time on our hands,\n\n\nthough liquor too in his case,\n\n\nnot mine.\n\n\n\n\nHow could I keep doing this,\n\n\nif I had to to do it forever?\n\n\nI remember to pray. Do it over again.\n\n\nRepeat, reread, rewrite.\n\n\nBow, and remember reverence.\n\n\nAgain, again. Practice { }\n\n\nDon’t presume to know what the day holds.\n\n\n\n\nIf it were simple maybe I’d need not repeat myself\n\n\nand repeat myself. If it were complex\n\n\nmaybe saying it once would suffice\n\n\nto anchor the pattern.\n\n\nIf there were a perceptible logic\n\n\nthen simplicity would occur.\n\n\nBut, no, logic breeds the complicated\n\n\nthe reasoned, the interminable excuses.\n\n\nSimple is the path to health, one breath at a time,\n\n\none refusal after another.\n\n\nI still don’t want your cure, Doctor.\n\n\nI still think you’ve got it wrong, Doctor.\n\n\nLet’s grab a drink and laugh about it.\n\n\nLet’s get down to the business\n\n\nof coming to terms with impending,\n\n\nongoing collapse. What’s the matter, doctor?\n\n\nWas that a threat?\n\n\n\n\nYou tell me that if so-called alternative treatment fails,\n\n\nI may not be get back on these meds?\n\n\nYou say that the adjudicators are only human,\n\n\nand so their reasoning may be:\n\n\n“Oh, well, if they wanted to go try natural medicine,\n\n\nwhy should we re-approve this expense?”\n\n\nDoctor, I am confused.\n\n\nWhy is it that my desire to seek other care\n\n\nmay later be punished?\n\n\nHumans, you say?\n\n\nNo, I am not so sure the impulse driving bureaucrats\n\n\nis a human agenda.\n\n\n\n\nTell me doctor,\n\n\nhow quickly do we fall through the cracks once our dissent is known\n\n\nto the legalese-fluent contract-dependent policy-breathing sort?\n\n\nHow little does it take for us to get blacklisted?\n\n\nOne misstep, or two?\n\n\nI say, Doctor, your thinly veiled threat sits with me.\n\n\nYou wish me luck and pawn me off\n\n\nto a specialist nearer-by\n\n\nas if you haematologists treat bodies, not numbers.\n\n\nYou make me sick, don’t make me laugh.\n\n\nNo, I would not rather be healthy, no thanks to you.\n\n\n\n\nHere, take some clonazepam, you’ll\n\n\nquickly feel better, then worse, then\n\n\ntake another, and soon enough\n\n\nthe numbness will forestall all\n\n\ncapacity for worry. Come on, let’s\n\n\ngo for a joyride. Oil’s pricey, sure,\n\n\nbut on your specialists’ salary?\n\n\nIndulge a bit. Get a friend\n\n\nto write that prescription for you\n\n\nsure beats sitting in a waiting room,\n\n\nwaiting to see the psych,\n\n\nknowing a fabulous act\n\n\nis about to be put on display.\n\n\nDepression’s a game we play\n\n\non stage, hide behind a mask\n\n\nof lights and pills, and whisper\n\n\ninto the lonely pillow at\n\n\nthe end of the 80 hour work week.\n\n\n\n\nOrientation’s finding your way,\n\n\nfeeling at home goes unnoticed\n\n\nuntil lost, disorientation results. Lost,\n\n\nunable to navigate and find my way.\n\n\n\n\nI do not know how I’m supposed to relate to my body.\n\n\nIt is mine with which to do as I please,\n\n\nto care for and mutilate and experiment with.\n\n\nYet I am at a loss, learning\n\n\nto navigate tides of being.\n\n\n\n\nA sick body is a magical labyrinth,\n\n\nfull of shifting corridors and dead ends.\n\n\nTo orient myself in this world, I rely on this labyrinth.\n\n\nI trust that it will guide me where we need to go.\n\n\nI am not the architect, only a passenger.\n\n\n\n\nA life lived through medicine is an incomplete form of existence,\n\n\none which foregoes so much agency,\n\n\nwhich must trust in the expertise\n\n\nof sometimes personally disagreeable individuals.\n\n\nThe architects thus far have been\n\n\nthose whose signatures prescribe my physiology.\n\n\nBeing diagnosed and treated is akin\n\n\nto a long game of pin the tale on the donkey,\n\n\nwhere the patient is both blindfolded and the donkey itself.\n\n\n\n\nWho better to undertake the journey through the depths?\n\n\nA glacier mountain ridge-line crawling single-file\n\n\nwith pilgrims seeking a detour and a view.\n\n\nEmbraced by the cold morning.\n\n\nDo go carefully, ye who seek alleged salvation.\n\n\nAre we not living beings?\n\n\nWhat greater opportunity for joy?\n\n\nThe inner grammar of sensation resounds\n\n\nwith gnosis if ye only tune to listen.\n\n\nThere is much embedded in the texts\n\n\nwhich drive my striving, but perhaps the answers\n\n\nbetter yet, the questions\n\n\nreside merely in the flesh borne of mother’s womb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nI am\nlooking\nat an image.\n\nA single page photocopy of an informational handout.\n\n\nIt is titled “General Guidelines for the Management of a Child with ITP”\n\n\nIn all likelihood, it was among the first documents that Maman received\nfrom healthcare professionals after my diagnosis in 2001, and it appears\nto be directed at schoolteachers. It’s a little bit outdated. Most\nnotably, ITP is now called ‘Immune Thrombocytopenia’ rather than\n‘Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura’, and there are more treatment\noptions than two decades ago.\n\n\nWriting in 2019, I have had an ITP diagnosis for 18 years.\n\n\nResearch from 2018 estimates that immune thrombocytopenia is found in\n8.8 out of 100’000 children.\n\n\nThe same research also finds that in 25% of ITP cases, the condition\nbecomes chronic, persistent: it does not simply go away. New diagnosis:\nChronic Immune Thrombocytopenia, found in 2.2 out of 100’000 children.\n\n\n\n\nI’m struck by a particular choice of words in the pamphlet:\n\n\n“benign disease.”\n\n\nMedical conditions are called benign to suggest they are not dangerous\nor serious. Benign can also mean kind, or kindly. I am one of the few\nwhose so-called benign disease turned into the chronic form.\n\n\nAs if auto-immunity were ever benign.\n\n\n\n\nIn the first months of treatment\n\n\nfrom August 10 2001 to May 14 2002,\n\n\nI received steroids,\n\n\nintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),\n\n\nPrednisone,\n\n\n51 blood tests,\n\n\nRho(D) immune globulin (RhIG)\n\n\nDexamethasone,\n\n\na bone marrow biopsy,\n\n\nand had my spleen removed.\n\n\n\n\nAfter which, I took penicillin\n\n\n(NOVO-PEN-VK 500 300MG)\n\n\ndaily\n\n\nfor a decade.\n\n\n(wikipedia: Phenoxymethylpenicillin)\n\n\nTreatment is still only ever palliative,\n\n\nmeaning that doctors manage symptoms\n\n\nbut do not seek a cure.\n\n\nMy ITP has always been around,\n\n\nand anytime my immune system is activated,\n\n\nit seeks out and destroys my platelets.\n\n\nPlatelets are an essential clotting factor.\n\n\n\n\nAuto-immunity is endlessly alienating and confusing. As a kid, I\nunderstood logically that I ‘was sick’ and might someday ’get better’\nbut was wholly unequipped to deal with the emotional and psychological\nrepercussions of living with a body that may or may not be bleeding at\nall times.\n\n\nThink of it this way: my body is a black box and my veins are\nSchrödinger’s cat.\n\n\nThe handout also has a very limited definition of “life style” but does\ncapture the restrictions imposed upon the child. Immunosuppressed to\navoid self-destruction, disallowed bodily contact sports to avoid\npotential external dangers. I was an isolated kid, but I don’t mean to\nsound down about it all. I turned out alright, but yeah, it sucked at\nthe time.\n\n\nThis document provided general information and guidelines for managing\nme, the child with ITP. It was intended for adults to have at least a\nvague sense of what was Wrong™ with me and adjust their treatment\naccordingly. As far as I recall, I never got a handout. Or counselling,\nuntil I sought it out myself 15 years down the line.\n\n\nIt is my intention in this book to vulgarize and translate my experience\nof illness in such a way as to be informative and engaging. I am telling\nyou a story. I want to share what I’ve been through, in the hope that my\nwords will resonate with others. I am not a doctor, I was a patient.\n\n\nIn attempting to show the research I do, I may get things wrong.\n\n\nI ask that you forgive such errors as you notice,\n\n\nand engage in a dialogue with me.\n\n\nThanks to Maman’s record keeping, I have a filing cabinet of my medical\ntranscripts, letters, general information and the like, which covers\nmost of my childhood post-diagnosis.\n\n\nThis is where I begin to disentangle it. I am setting out on an\narchaeological dig of the medical knowledge that was produced about me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019-09-27\n\n\nFrom The Hospital On The Day Of The Climate March\n\n\n\n\nAt the oncology-haematology clinic, \nthe wait time was only about 8 minutes.\n\nThe CHUM’s 14th floor waiting room’s got a wall of windows\n\n\ninto the azure and the river.\n\n\nPortable FM feeds my earbuds live coverage of the day’s main event.\n\n\nA guest-host panders to us all, repeating that everyone has limits they\nmust face, that we must all contend with ourselves and do what we can\nwithin our communities, that one of the great projects for anyone who is\nalive right now is to try being as human as possible within dehumanizing\nsystems.\n\n\nBlood test took all of 30 seconds.\n\n\nRoutine.\n\n\n\n\nNext, 12 floors down, tucked away above the main entrance, lounges\nGastroenterology, where the blue room has no windows. I checked in\nearly, 10:12, hopeful I’d have some energy left over to march.\n\n\nFinally, noon, was not greeted by a doctor.\n\n\nThe desk clerk asks me: “Can you come back next week?”\n\n\nDue to a system error, the MD wasn’t notified of my arrival.\n\n\nSo the time had passed. She couldn’t see me.\n\n\nNext week? Huh. Ok.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least I have the institutional note from the day of the climate\nmarch.\n\n\nI stayed tuned in to radio coverage as I left the hospital, north then\nwest, arrived at Saint-Laurent metro, and watched the crowd.\n\n\nHeard it and and its cries many minutes before\n\n\neyes glimpsed details of its millipede limbs over groaning asphalt.\n\n\nContingents of friends singers dancers rolling, celebrating,\n\n\nall blended into the marching worm wafting\n\n\ndespair\n\n\nand jouissance.\n\n\nSticking from the ground were red and yellow metal acoustic tubes,\n\n\ndistorting and delaying the cheers and chants.\n\n\nThere, in the streets, bidding farewell to the earth,\n\n\nwere so many of us, it is haunting.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s bitter irony I have not yet resolved\n\n\nin facing obstacles to action imposed by a body\n\n\nhaving only just the energy to survive and remain calm.\n\n\nDoubtless, many of the people attending\n\n\nto waiting rooms that day wished to be demonstrating instead.\n\n\nWe too wanted to feel a part of a seething mass.\n\n\nInstead, we patiently sat in chairs, awaiting expert examination,\n\n\nhoping our bodily prognosis is better than that of this earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA slow gunmetal ooze creeps like magma\n\n\nbut does not glow or emit its warmth.\n\n\nPressure mounts in my chest a clarion-call\n\n\nnoiseless signal that life remains, pains and all.\n\n\nAwake to the body’s below-all-the-dust and roses there\n\n\nexists a self which, shaped by the world, surpasses it.\n\n\nTranscendent to the last day. A self a precious few find\n\n\nthanks to the forces of circumstance.\n\n\nAnchored and buoyed along the path I am\n\n\nsoothed in my frenzied preparations by reminders to slow down.\n\n\nMy lifeline in a frenzy of deadlines is continuous\n\n\nawareness that the worlds within me sap the world.\n\n\nEach new attempt is faced with greater knowledge\n\n\nand skill. Baggage is a dirty word, but with it comes\n\n\na survival guide. Tools of the mind and soul\n\n\nto equip and take on life’s trials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hear within myself: You are not doing enough.\n\n\nThat voice may always be there.\n\n\nThere is no other way to exist in a world that is ending\n\n\nbut community support.\n\n\nNothing to be done except mutual aid,\n\n\nthe creation of spaces for grief and joy.\n\n\nSo what now?\n\n\nPerhaps calm is a coping mechanism,\n\n\nbecause to lose calm is to fall far, deep, lost.\n\n\nunsustainable emotions when there are bills due on the 1st.\n\n\nI just try to get enough sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Chameleon Ethic\n\n\n\n\nParallels can be drawn between trans experience and chronic\nillness,\nbut making up a list won’t get at the truth of it.\nSo many knots in my chest leave me uneasy.\nI try to sit with them and feel them out\nbut untangling roots is often more than I can do alone.\nI try not to retreat into numbness, with its familiar haze.\nWhen I let myself numb to life, I lose the magic that is: feeling.\nEmotions are exhausting, but at least they are true.\nI’ve been sick so long that I forget what an effect illness has on life.\nLet me be clear, when I say illness, I don’t mean an occasional\ncold/flu.\nI mean long-term, recurring, full of unknowns\nno matter how many test results pile up in a file.\nWhen I speak of illness I mean the ever-present sense of bodily doubt,\nof not knowing whether it will ever be possible to trust my body.\nRadical Left politics of anti-ableism would have me accept my illness.\nMy leanings toward a zen worldview would as well.\nBut how can I possibly be equanimous?\nMy mind is riddled with self-judgement at my body’s\ninability to keep up, ever after all the years.\n\n\nI figure maybe I’ll Get Better.\n\nBetter implying an inherent lack in sick bodies.\n\n\nBetter positing that sick bodies are\n\nunable to conduct themselves in valuable ways.\n\nBetter stating that illness is morally\n\ninferior to health, and so it is for its bearer.\n\nBetter implying that a body’s worth is\n\ndetermined by their ability to generate surplus value.\n\nBetter making clear that value only exists\n\noutside the cycle of chronic illness.\n\nBetter saying that there is no value\n\nin the process of perpetual healing.\n\nBetter affirming\n\n“you’d be happier if you were healthy.”\n\nBetter reminding us that sick bodies are\n\nto be pitied for their state of being.\n\nWhat is truly meant when stating Get Better is:\n\nget back to work.\n\n\n\nI say I don’t “function properly”, as if my body were a machine\n\n\n“Keep up”, as if I’m running a footrace and my body is dragging down the\nteam.\n\n\nThe truth is that my body can not and will not\n\n\never operate at any rhythm or capacity other than its own.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve burned out every other year since turning 18,\n\n\nand each time I get back on my feet after some period of unproductivity,\n\n\nI wonder how to better make Being Productive a sustainable endeavour.\n\n\n\n\nMy thinking is inherently flawed,\n\n\nand is the result of capital’s insidious grasp over my mind.\n\n\nInherently flawed, because I am thinking about my body as the problem,\n\n\nas a puzzle to be cracked.\n\n\n\n\nIf I only eat right, exercise, meditate, don’t drink, take my meds,\nsleep 9 hours a night…\n\n\nTHEN I’ll Be Better enough to exist frictionlessly.\n\n\nInjunctions such as Be Well turn the well-meaning speaker\n\n\ninto a prophet upholding morality, that false virtue of health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey tell you to be well\n\n\nand parrot the priestly call to piety.\n\n\nHow many patients internalize a narrative\n\n\nof illness as punishment for some wrongdoing?\n\n\nThe end of that story is cure through repentance.\n\n\n\n\nMy desire to get better is only rivalled by my rage at the\ninescapability of the system\n\n\nthat perpetually makes unsustainable demands of all bodies,\n\n\nsick or otherwise, human or otherwise, living or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\nI try to develop all the right habits and I still find myself in crisis.\nI scramble for self-preservation only to find that everyone else is\nsinking too. No amount of internalized wellness rhetoric changes that my\nbody is prone to random bouts of self-destruction, that the structures\nthat guide labour and consumption as they exist today make no\naffordances for predictably unpredictable health. I work 40 hours a week\nbecause it seems like the thing to do. Because is seems like having a\nsteady paycheck that lets me do more than just survive may be worth it.\n\n\n\n\nBut what is it really worth?\n\n\nIs it worth my mental health to take any job with a salary and\ndissociate 8 hours a day?\n\n\nIs it worth the energy commitment, not having enough left over\n\n\nto see my loved ones even kind of regularly?\n\n\nIs it worth the feelings of isolation that comes with being\n\n\na closeted trans in a Progressive™ office environment?\n\n\nThe kind of place that has social-inclusion policies in place, though\ntheir efficacy is doubtful at best.\n\n\nIs it worth creating friction in the system in order to Live My\nIdentity?\n\n\nOr would my identity be better lived elsewhere?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I write this, I’m about to embark on an overnight laxative journey\n\n\nin order to adequately prepare myself for a colonoscopy\n\n\nscheduled tomorrow morning.\n\n\nA look inside my bowels to check if I’m bleeding.\n\n\nThey’re looking for the cause of my anemia,\n\n\nas if ITP wasn’t enough of an answer.\n\n\nI suppose that Medically Speaking, it isn’t.\n\n\nIt had been over 2 years since I last visited with the\ngastroenterologist, and our meeting lasted less than 10 minutes. Dr.\nGuts looked at my numbers and evinced confusion:\n\n\n“Your iron is still low,” she said,\n\n\n“and… your platelets jumped from 19 to 427 last April.”\n\n\n“Yes,” I confirmed, “I rested that month.”\n\n\n“Your platelets shot that high because you…rested?”\n\n\n“Yes, that’s what I said.”\n\n\nMy platelets were low when I checked into the ER in late that one night\nin March 2019 due to high fever. I spent the night sitting under\nfluorescents in a half-lotus, listening, taking in the noise. My regular\nblood doctor was the attendant haematologist, and he upped my regular\nmeds when he got around to my hallway-bound cot at 7am the next morning.\nSo in April the meds I was taking everyday were doing their thing, too.\nMy haematologist and I have a decent working relationship. He’s followed\nmy case since I was 19, he knows what my body’s up to.\n\n\nDr. Guts, the gastroenterologist, I saw for the first time in 2017 when\nby her careful hand tubes with cameras insinuated through me to check\nwhether some part of my large intestine or bowels was bleeding. They\nwere not. The experience was deeply troubling. Perhaps some of you have\nbeen through this procedure: Drugged to near-total dissociation with\nfentanyl, I was out cold for the majority of the invasion. I had a\nsingle moment of lucidity. My oesophagus was occupied by plastic, my\nintestine shifting uneasily to accommodate the probe. I was aware of\nmovement inside me. Not alarmed, not in pain, only aware. My stomach,\ndistended in odd ways, occupied my attention. I did not see. I knew what\nwas happening, what I had agreed to. I waited, patiently, comatose. They\nfound my insides to be positively normal.\n\n\n\n\nDr. Guts: “After the procedure in 2017,\n\n\nI prescribed you iron supplement pills.”\n\n\n“Yes,” I acquiesced, “they stopped working.”\n\n\n“They worked for a while,” she points out astutely.\n\n\nResearch has found that oral iron supplement treatments generally take\n6-8 months to fix the problem and restore the body’s iron levels. Two\nyears after the little red pills, my iron levels have generally remained\nquite low, my iron-deficiency anaemia without a clear fix. From April to\nMay 2019, I received iron intravenously.\n\n\nThat almost did the trick.\n\n\nSince the original procedure in 2017, I have twice received undiscussed\nand unexpected summons for another gastroscopy-endoscopy, in spite of my\ndoctor confirming that the original examination and accompanying\nbiopsies yielded no results. Part of me thinks Dr. Guts just really\nenjoys performing this particular test.\n\n\nUntil now, I have refused to undergo the procedure again. We’ve\ndiscussed other options, so I remain confused as to why that procedure\nwas requisitioned again. Yet here we are, December 2019, and tomorrow\nthey’re checking.\n\n\nI agreed to this. I’m afraid of the consequences of not following\nmedical orders. I spend a lot of my time concerned with the\npersonal/political consequences of ingesting such and such food or media\nproduct. I feel so porous, affected by everything I consume, medicine\nincluded. When it comes to medical orders, I follow them critically.\nThat is to say, I follow them. I do not presume to know how to balance\nmy body’s chemical load better than my MDs. I feel how the variety of\nmedications affect me, but currently lack knowledge about their\nbiological functioning or the targets we are trying to reach. Even\nthough I doubt anything will come\n\n\nfrom this test or the next, I agree.\n\n\nBecause I know this:\n\n\na normal amount of blood platelets is 150’000-300′000 per microliter of\nblood,\n\n\nand my counts in 2019, after 18 blood tests, have been between 9000 and\n427’000.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I do what I’m told, they stabilize;\n\n\nwhen I forget to take meds, omit to fill a prescription,\n\n\nor otherwise live life counter to medical recommendations,\n\n\nthey plummet.\n\n\n\n\nSo, each evening,\n\n\nI take a small orange pill marked 50mg,\n\n\nand a white one marked 25mg of the same.\n\n\n\n\nHaving chronic illness means giving up a degree of agency that many\npeople take for granted.\n\n\nI don’t have control over what doctors decide is necessary for my body.\n\n\nThat’s distressing, but I still have trust that the public-system\n\n\nspecialists who examine me have my Health (nebulous concept) in mind.\n\n\nThe same cannot be said for many other ways\n\n\nin which bodily autonomy is taken from individuals.\n\n\nThe medical violence I experience as a byproduct of treatment is of the\nsoftest sort.\n\n\nI’m working class, but I haven’t fallen through the cracks.\n\n\nI am, for all intents and purposes in the medical system, a man.\n\n\nI am not out there seeking hormone replacement therapy.\n\n\nAnd why not?\n\n\nI barely have the energy to make it through my weeks\n\n\nI am not about to compound that\n\n\nwith the social burden of coming out\n\n\nto everyone everywhere all the time.\n\n\nI don’t have the courage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Hyphema and Childhood Glaucoma\n\n\n\n\nI am\nlooking\nat a letter\nthat was faxed from my then-ophthalmologist\n\n(eye doctor) in Vancouver to my soon-ophthalmologist in Ottawa.\n\n\nRight before I was diagnosed with Immune Thrombocytopenia,\n\n\nI was playing by myself while I waited for Maman to finish\n\n\nmeeting with my Waldorf school kindergarten teacher.\n\n\nI had just been given back a toy that was confiscated\n\n\nand I was very excited to resume playing with it.\n\n\n\n\nAs fate would have it, the spinning toy turned on me\n\n\nand flew at my right eye, causing permanent damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a red day.\n\n\nRed as to stain my vision.\n\n\nRed with weep, sorrow.\n\n\nRed with pain, confusion.\n\n\nRed like the couches and the carpets\n\n\nin the first clinic my mother brought me to,\n\n\nthe one that started it all.\n\n\nRed that seeped into my right eye\n\n\nby a moment of inattention in the schoolyard,\n\n\nall thanks to the serrated plastic edge of a dragonfly.\n\n\nThat clinic referred us to British Columbia Children’s Hospital. It’s\nunnerving to think that without this injury,\n\n\nI might not have been brought to a clinic or hospital anytime soon, and\nwould have wandered the world of childhood, platelet-less, extremely\nvulnerable to any physical injury, with no one the wiser, and no\ndiagnosis. I’m grateful that my vulnerability made itself known through\nthis eye injury, rather than blunt force impact to something more vital.\nThe usual “bumps and bruises” of childhood.\n\n\nIn the subsequent months my eye bled into itself repeatedly, so I\neventually lost all “useful” vision.\n\n\n“Total hyphema” refers to complete filling of the eye’s front chamber\nwith blood.\n\n\n\n\nIn my case, this led to glaucoma and loss of sight.\n\n\nI don’t know when exactly it was that my right eye stopped Seeing.\n\n\nI don’t remember what it’s like to see out of both eyes.\n\n\nI don’t miss it. I may as well have been born like this,\n\n\nwere it not for notable intra-ocular pressure.\n\n\n\n\nIntraocular pressure (IOP) is the measure of pressure that has built up\nwithin a given eyeball.\n\n\nEye pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).\n\n\nNormal eye pressure ranges from 12-22 mm Hg,\n\n\nand eye pressure of greater than 22 mm Hg is considered higher than\nnormal.\n\n\n\n\nAfter surgery, my doctor notes, my glaucoma-affected eye\n\n\nwas found to be at “a satisfactory 22 mm Hg.”\n\n\nExcellent, I adore being satisfactory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the doctors don’t mention amongst themselves\n\n\nis the impact of this intra-ocular pressure on basic quality of life.\n\n\nIOP causes pain, and when my right eye was in pain,\n\n\nthe signals interfered with the left, the “useful” eye.\n\n\nI couldn’t focus my sight on anything, concentrate,\n\n\nor, god forbid, hold sustained eye contact.\n\n\nI felt isolated and alone.\n\n\n\n\nITP meant I was barred from most forms of physical activity.\n\n\nIOP meant sleepless nights that bled into fuzzy days and years of ocular\nshut-in.\n\n\nAt school, sitting in a corner, book in hand, my glaucoma turned me into\na Curiosity.\n\n\n\n\nMy right eye developed a cloudy white-blue-green colour that I have\ngrown to love in my adult life. Not so, as a child. From the age of 5,\nwhen I “lost” my vision, until the age of 16 or so, when I had my last\neye surgery, my unseeing eye would regularly keep me up at night in\nagony until I passed out from exhaustion.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was little, Maman and I had a routine:\n\n\nFirst, I would scream or whimper, sometime in the evening,\n\n\nusually around bedtime, when I was already tired\n\n\nand no longer had the capacity to ignore the discomfort.\n\n\nBeing tired always makes the eye act up, even to this day.\n\n\nSo, I would make known that I was in pain, one way or another,\n\n\nand try to smother it in a pillow or a series of cold-compresses.\n\n\nIOP pain feels like my eye is going to explode.\n\n\nIt felt like an ever-inflating ball inside my skull.\n\n\nI couldn’t see out of the offending eye,\n\n\nso where sight used to be there was only colourful pain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI kind of understood what was going on,\n\n\nbut that was of little comfort in day-to-day life.\n\n\nChildren have no qualms about\n\n\npointing, staring, asking intrusive questions,\n\n\nventuring patchwork guesses about the nature of someone’s difference.\n\n\nI heard everything from\n\n\n“your eye grants you oracular powers” (which I like)\n\n\nto “your eye is that way because someone’s cum got stuck in it”\n\n\n(which fuelled mountains of internalized homophobia)\n\n\n\n\nKids say stupid things, nothing new here.\n\n\nStill, it’s important for me to acknowledge\n\n\nhow physical difference, especially visible difference from others,\n\n\ncan be deeply distressing as a child.\n\n\nMy visual impairment is a minor disability\n\n\nthat has not gotten in the way of most things I attempt to do in life.\n\n\nSelf-effacing caveat aside,\n\n\nhaving a single blind eye\n\n\nmade me a target\n\n\nof harassment\n\n\nand bullying\n\n\nfor years.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes it took the form of a kid hiding around a corner,\n\n\nwaiting to jump-scare me on my blind side\n\n\nand then lording my inability to see over my head at any opportunity.\n\n\nSometimes there were snide comments.\n\n\nOftentimes there was no harm meant,\n\n\nbut I still felt myself ever more distant from my peers\n\n\nas a result of Seeing different and looking different.\n\n\n\n\nAnyone with eyes is likely to agree:\n\n\nan eye is a very sensitive, delicate ball of goop.\n\n\nJust as much as eyes are\n\n\nmuch-vaunted windows to the soul,\n\n\neyes are a means to an end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the contemporary north american city, image-saturated,\n\n\nsight is how I apprehend the world,\n\n\nit is what I was taught to focus on as the sense of Primary Importance.\n\n\nSeeing is primordial to Normal Existence,\n\n\nand eye-contact is how we first build empathy and human connection.\n\n\nI never regained that much lauded Useful Vision.\n\n\n\n\nBy medical standards, my sight is subpar,\n\n\nand my remaining eye must be protected\n\n\n(I tend to agree).\n\n\n\n\nInstead of useful vision my stunted optic nerve\n\n\nreacts to light and dark\n\n\npicks up on movement\n\n\nextends my spatial awareness\n\n\nin ways that differ from seeing.\n\n\n\n\nMy right eye won’t leave my “useful” left vision alone.\n\n\nIt gets in the way. In my living memory I have never seen double,\n\n\nbut my optic nerve has always kept providing me\n\n\nwith some kind of information.\n\n\nMy right eye does not see, but it feels.\n\n\nIt feels the wind on a cold winter day.\n\n\nIt feels the warmth of direct sunlight like exposed skin.\n\n\nMy occluded, not-useful ball of sense receptors\n\n\nhas maintained hyper-sensitivity to light.\n\n\nThe right eye feeds me never ending waves\n\n\nof colour and light patterns,\n\n\na world of my own\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDreamt\n\n\n\n\nCrystal clear deciduous dreams \n\nwhere a body uprooted taps\n\n\nback into the rhizome\n\n\nUp on the fronds new wings\n\n\ntake flight by attempting\n\n\nfirst to fall but find wind\n\n\nCaught in the bark a beetle\n\n\nnestles mandibles ever deeper\n\n\ntunnels and lays the grub\n\n\n\n\nHum along the chestnut cache\n\n\nburied where roots gape,\n\n\ndirt piles with the years.\n\n\nIt’s memory that’s held in the decay\n\n\nleaves nothing behind and unturned\n\n\nsleep remembers a simple moment\n\n\nMovement, the woodpecker’s red crest\n\n\nstaggers to its rhythm. It finds\n\n\nthe beetle hidden, almost.\n\n\n\n\nA swallowed breath hangs\n\n\nwhere the beaver decided not to cut:\n\n\ncustodial intelligence is gently exercised.\n\n\n\n\nExcitement builds to a fever pitch\n\n\nWhere the fox spreads its tidings\n\n\nA party, soon to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHilarity is a generalized state.\n\n\nIt’s happenstance and coincidence\n\n\nthat illusion of unexpected crossings.\n\n\nExpect less.

The doctors adopt a formal and clinical tone, getting right to\nthe facts of injury, illness, and treatment. My doctor knows his\nintended audience:\nOther Doctors.\nMD to MD.\nWhy, then, does each letter stress that I was such a nice boy? How is it\nmedically relevant to the treatment of my eyes and blood whether a boy\nor I’m nice? Getting gendered by medical authority carries weight.\nMedical sex, as well as gender presentation, seriously impacts how a\npatient is treated by their doctors.\nI have to wonder whether, on the flip side of the gender binary, Dr. C\nwould have referred to me as a nice girl, or added some kind of\ndiminutive? Nice Little Girl, for good measure? I can only speculate,\nbut it seems likely enough. The words we use have everything to do with\nour environment, and middle-aged men risk carrying subtle hints of\nmisogyny everywhere they go, including their medical practice.\nIn the treatment of ITP, I can understand how the possession of a uterus\nimpacts treatment after menstruation. What I’m struggling to wrap my\nhead around is why my eye-care specialist felt the need to specify, in\neach of his letters, that I was a Nice Boy. There’s an easy enough\nexplanation: in general, all children get gender assigned, in all walks\nof life, in a million contexts where it shouldn’t matter. This is just\none more example of that. Nothing new here. But I’m not satisfied by\nthat answer.\nMaybe the language is less stilted than the more clinical The Patient,\nbut it is ultimately less accurate to call me a boy than to call me a\npatient.\nIn operation reports, I am The Patient. The function of the documents is\nthe same, isn’t it? The letters and the reports? Both provide\ninformation about the status of me, Patient/Nice Boy, in order for other\ndoctors to know how things were going with my condition.\nThe major difference I can pin down stems from whether or not I was\nconscious during the time period referenced in the document. If I was\nawake, during a checkup, I was Matthieu-Xavier the Nice Boy. If I was\nunder anaesthetic, during surgery, I became The Patient.\nDuring routine checkups, I had a voice. I answered questions. Shared how\nI felt, whether I was in any pain. During surgery, I had no feeling,\nlost all subjectivity. I was asleep. The purpose of our interactions was\nfundamentally different. From Nice Boy to Patient all thanks to some\nanaesthetic.\nAt least Patient stands the test of time. I was only a boy because I’d\nbeen told my whole life that I was a boy and didn’t know I had the\noption to disagree, to dissent. I was a boy because terms of endearment\nlike “my little man” have been levelled at me forever. I was a boy\nbecause I got Jurassic Park toys and Hot Wheels and Beyblades and those\nare Boy Toys. I was a boy because I had scruffy short hair. I was a nice\nboy because I listened to the doctor.\nIs the use of Nice Boy a way to show empathy? To acknowledge that I am\nnot only a collection of symptoms, despite what the present letter would\notherwise have us believe? By acknowledging my niceness, my boyness, the\ndoctor may be saying:\n“This child has a life of some kind\noutside our scope of knowledge,\noutside of medicine.”\nTo deem me merely The Patient would have reduced my childhood to\nillness, pathology and nothing else.\nTo be a Nice Boy in my doctor’s letters means he was concerned with my\nwellbeing.\nI remember the ophthalmology wing at BC Children’s Hospital in 2001.\nThose appointments were separate from the ITP checkups. We walked back\nand forth from oncology. I was at the hospital almost daily that first\nyear.\nMy eye specialist, Dr. C., who wrote this letter, was a competent doctor\nand a kind man. Week after week I sat in his examination chair while he\nprodded my eyes with ophthalmic instruments and did what he could to\nsave my sight. He failed of course, but that was no fault of his. The\ncare proffered by the coalition of doctors and pharmaceutical\nconglomerates is a tendril of empire.\nThe doctors convene conferences on autoimmunity.\nI imagine they share stories of our bodies’\ndysfunctions over cocktails\nand look out at the Adriatic sea\nfrom the hotel bar in Athens.\nDoes the haematologist foot the bill himself,\nor does the institution?\nAre patients in attendance?\nPhysicians are on such a pedestal,\nall the better to market their expertise in private practice\nwith such snappy blog-posts as\n“14 ways to cure auto-immune disease”\nThe short of it? Consult with them for 350$/hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiving A Dose\n\n\n\n\nI’ve got a notion of time crawling\n\nbut the room stays the same.\n\n\nI patiently examine clocks distractions and infusion pumps\n\n\nas they move and mark different passings.\n\n\n\n\nI use the clock to remind myself clinical purgatory\n\n\nis impermanent and localized.\n\n\nWhile the body sits imbibing the fluid hung from stainless steel\n\n\nserved in pristine glass bottles and gently deflating plastic sacks.\n\n\n\n\nThe pump serves to regulate my donor-plasma-derived blood feast,\n\n\nmaking sure I don’t consume too much, too fast, too little, too slow.\n\n\nThe translucent saline drip opacifies the superstructures\n\ninherent to (con)temporary cure.\n\n\n\nObserving the drip, I easily forget that though the needles seem free,\n\n\nthis watery lifeblood implicates me in the systems I hate.\n\n\nA cannula is feeding me intravenous immunoglobulin and saline solution.\n\n\nIt was not the first time, it was not the last time.\n\n\n\n\nI am an expert at sitting in hospital chairs\n\n\nbut still have no feeling of power, for my many years of experience.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve accepted that my doctor knows what my body needs,\n\nif little else of the world.\n\nWorld which, outside these clinical walls,\n\nis rich with joy and sorrow.\n\nBut none of that matters now.\n\n\n\n\nNow, I am sitting in a blue chair among blue walls,\n\n\nbleeding red in purple veins while crystal clear\n\nplasma fractionations\nmake up the difference.\n\nGo on sitting, isn’t it comfortable?\n\n\nHave you ever tried a LUMEX? Best designed chairs around.\n\n\nSit for hours in total comfort.\n\n\nStandard issue LUMEX Clinical Care Recliner,\n\ndesigned for blood-work versatility.\n\nDrawing, letting, and transfusing are all viable activities.\n\n\n\n\nAs a child I was called a vampire, I embraced it.\n\n\nI figure a vampire is simply\n\n\none who requires liquid supplementation to survive;\n\n\none whose blood does not support them on its own;\n\n\none whose body is deeply vulnerable\n\nto specific circumstances.\n\n\n\nReceiving intravenous treatment implicates\n\n\nme in vampiric economic processes\n\n\nfacilitated by biotechnology.\n\n\nBlood feasts are involuntary, necessary.\n\n\nUnlike the mythical vampires,\n\n\nhaunting minds and prowling hunting grounds,\n\n\nmy offerings come to me, served up\n\nthrough hollow needles handled by steady hands.\n\n\n\nSoon afterwards, my body is mine again.\n\n\nMy vampirism is short-lived, if recurrent.\n\n\nIt leaves traces: needle marks, legal restrictions.\n\n\nMy lovers cannot donate blood; I am considered risky.\n\n\n\n\nCombining so many bodies in a transfusion leaves me\n\n\nbrimming with Otherness of the sort blood banks write off.\n\n\nAccording to those keepers of frozen life, my blood is impure,\n\n\nit is a poisonous potion that risks infecting others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo much of what I consume is involuntary.\n\n\nNauseous exhaust, pesticides, heavy metals, microplastics.\n\n\nI am needfully careful about what I do choose.\n\n\nA process of elimination, spiraling around a primary principle:\n\n\nchoose what comes from the nearest geographical place,\n\n\nand which has undergone the fewest transformations.\n\n\n\n\nNo coffee, no tea, no chocolate, no refined sugar.\n\n\nAlcohol depends on the season, and only ever as a food, not an\nintoxicant.\n\n\nCannabis depends on the season,\n\n\nand is best consumed mixed with other smoking herbs.\n\n\nSome sources of pleasure, introspection, and social joy.\n\n\n\n\nVitamins and supplements seem necessary\n\n\nonly because the food that is available for purchase is deficient\n\n\nin nearly all nutrients. There is a vicious cycle at work,\n\n\neducating bodies to consume synthetics\n\n\nrather than what comes from nature.\n\n\n\n\nPrescribed pharmaceuticals are useful, undeniably.\n\n\nUseful in mitigating symptoms in times of crisis.\n\n\nBut what happens upon habituation?\n\n\n\n\nA chronic treatment engenders chronic illness.\n\n\nIf a body is always consuming synthetic chemicals,\n\n\nit never learns to heal itself.\n\n\n\n\nTime does not stop, sat in the blue chair, but it does change.\n\n\nThe clock changes, bends to the body’s will.\n\n\nIt is the body that determines how long it will take\n\n\nto fully absorb the dose, how long I will be seated.\n\n\nDrain the sterile bag of its precious contents\n\n\nand claim them as part of myself.\n\n\nIt feels like I have no say, I am the witness.\n\n\nI observe the process and feel the newness within me.\n\n\nWhose body is it, anyway?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB-12 Adventures\n\n\n\n\nAll my body’s resources have been somehow drained.\n\nWe play catch-up every day of the week, friends.\n\n\nThe able-bodied can hardly conceive this sort of fatigue.\n\n\nThis is not just feeling tired.\n\n\nThis fatigue doesn’t care how many hours of sleep I got last night\n\n\nwhat I’ve eaten today, or for my intake of stimulants\n\n\nThis fatigue is the result of a hobbled immune system\n\n\nswinging its swords at the wrong targets.\n\n\n\n\nBacked into a corner by viral infection, it lashes out.\n\n\nNot quite at random, but with poor enough aim\n\n\nthat most of my platelets bite the dust at the same time.\n\n\nMy immune system feels like a dormant weapon of mass destruction.\n\n\n\n\nDays get long when your blood is unbalanced.\n\n\nI’ve been sitting in a chair all day and still managed a head-rush.\n\n\nI need to pack more snacks. Seems my anemia is bad these days.\n\n\nMy B12 must be at an all-time low,\n\n\nconsidering I’ve been prescribed a monthly shot.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve elected to give them to myself this time around.\n\n\nI do not have enough free time to go to the clinic for a shot every\nmonth\n\n\nwhen I have the option of doing it at home.\n\n\nI learned what to do through watching nurses, plus a youtube video.\n\n\nI’ve now administered myself the shot 3 times.\n\n\nThe first attempt was a misfire. I froze. I was scared.\n\n\nNever before had I held a thin metal-tipped\n\n\nplastic syringe in my own hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I remember being a child playing in the bath\n\n\nWe kept some of the medical syringes used to dose oral drugs\n\n\nThey held a few milliliters of liquid\n\n\nI used them as water guns in my games.\n\n\n\n\nNow worries swim through my mind:\n\n\nWhat if I accidentally contaminated one of the elements of this\nprocedure?\n\n\nWill I inject myself with bacteria?\n\n\nWhat if I inject myself with air?\n\n\nThey say fresh air cures all\n\n\nbut I’m not sure that applies when taken intramuscularly.\n\n\n\n\nSo many needles in my life, always in other hands.\n\n\nSo, on the first attempt I scrapped the supplies.\n\n\nI made it all the way to the part where the syringe was primed with\nfluid,\n\n\nneedle in my arm, ready to deliver its payload.\n\n\nI took a few deep breaths, to no avail.\n\n\nI could not overcome my nerves on that first attempt.\n\n\n\n\nThe second time around was a success.\n\n\nI realized that with my scheduled flu shot coming up,\n\n\nit was imperative that the B12 be taken before the influenza,\n\n\notherwise I would not recuperate from the shot.\n\n\n\n\nThis was back in November, during college finals.\n\n\nSo on my way home from my job,\n\n\nI stopped at the pharmacy and purchased a new syringe\n\n\nPut 40 cents on my credit card\n\n\n\n\nI got home, and dropped the many\n\n\nearly-winter layers of protection I was wearing\n\n\nhaphazardly around my tiny apartment\n\n\nin my rush to get the shot over with.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I washed my hands, then I gathered up my supplies.\n\n\n1ml SANDOZ Vitamine B12 1000MCG/ML (DIN 00521515)\n\n\nwhich had cost me 8,37$\n\n\nand had not gone through on the RAMQ public insurance.\n\n\nNext, generic isopropyl alcohol sterilization pads,\n\n\nthe 1ml syringe, and a finger-shaped Band-Aid™ for afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nI chose the only part of me that has enough fatty tissue,\n\n\nin order to avoid injecting too deep, and prepared the injection site.\n\n\nAs I approached the needle, it brushed up against one of my fingers.\n\n\nThat was almost enough for me to call it off then and there.\n\n\nSelf-administered shots are nerve-wracking business.\n\n\nWhat if I had compromised the needle’s sterility\n\n\nand ended up with blood poisoning?\n\n\n\n\nI took a deep breath, and carried on.\n\n\nUltimately unfounded worries.\n\n\nBefore I knew it the needle had been inserted\n\n\nand the syringe plunger was waiting for its action.\n\n\n\n\nMore deep breathing.\n\n\nIn: ready yourself.\n\n\n\n\nOut: slowly contract your left hand’s thumb so as to inject the B12\nfluid.\n\n\nWatch it happen in the mirror, hardly feeling,\n\n\ncaught up in breathing, pushing away the fear.\n\n\nIn certain contexts the Bene Gesserit mantra rings true:\n\n\nFear is the mind killer.\n\n\nI feared that I was unable to safely take the necessary steps.\n\n\nI wanted to defer to a Professional. It boils down to this:\n\n\nI feared that I hadn’t the ability to take care of myself.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s always the fear when faced with a new challenge.\n\n\nWill I be able to do what is required in order to continue living?\n\n\nSo far the answer has always been yes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Visit To The Blood Doctor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI saw my haematologist (blood specialist) recently.\n\nWell, first, I saw a Resident doctor under his tutelage.\n\n\nThis Resident had an air of confidence in her knowledge,\n\n\nseemed nervous holding down the clinic.\n\n\n\n\nAs I reported on my recent health and confirmed the information on file,\nshe took simple notes in neat handwriting. She then asked me to wait\nwhile she went to speak with my doctor. The young Resident returned with\nDr. O, a kindly middle-aged man with whom I have a good working\nrelationship.\n\n\nHe commented that I look well, to go along with my numbers, which have\nbeen positive as of late following a tumultuous year. We have the data\nto back this up: 18 recent blood tests. Not an an all-time yearly high\nfor me, but a respectable amount. Dr. O noted that my hair seemed\n\nespecially curly.\n\n“You’re always reinventing yourself.” he quipped.\n\n\n“Well, I’m young.” I replied.\n\n\nWe exchange some pleasant banter. I’m probably one of his younger\npatients. He’s been following my case since I was 19, and has seen me go\nthrough a number of phases and changes.\n\n\nWhen I first met Dr. O in 2015 I was hospitalized. I had recently moved\nto Montreal and didn’t have a specialist yet. It was my second semester\nof university, I had overworked myself and caught influenza. He got me\nsorted out.\n\n\n\n\nThat year, I was transfused a few rounds of Intravenous Immunoglobulin\n(IVIG), which got my platelets to shoot up briefly before plummeting\nagain. There’s a lot to be said about this drug, but that’s for later.\nFor now, suffice to mention that it’s a common treatment for ITP and\nother medical conditions.\n\n\nLater that same year, Dr. O got me on a more recent medication, which I\nstill take now (as of writing, in early 2020). Presently, I am\nprescribed 75mg of Revolade®, manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals\nCanada Inc. This medication’s active component is “eltrombopag”, which\nis a “thrombopoietin receptor agonist.”\n\n\nI have been taking this medication at varied dosages since mid-2015. Its\npurpose is to act as a productivity coach for my bone marrow, urging it\nto produce more blood platelets. The pills come in 25, 50, or 75mg\ncompositions of different colours.\n\n\nI speculate that the pills are different colours because it makes them\neasily identifiable on the factory floor, so that a 50mg pill has a\nrather slim chance of finding itself in a packet of 25mg pills.\n\n\nIn fact, I have never seen such a mixup, so I suppose their system is\nworking. No, mixups in dosage have always come from human error on my\nend. I’m pretty good about remembering to take my meds now. It’s baked\ninto my daily routine, but sometimes I’ll forget.\n\n\n\nSkeletal formula of eltrombopag olamine,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll be out of the house with plans to\n\n\nstay elsewhere overnight, and didn’t bring my pills.\n\n\nOr I waited too long before calling the pharmacy\n\n\nto renew, so I’ve got none left,\n\n\nand it’s Saturday right now,\n\n\nand the pharmacy doesn’t get any deliveries on Sunday,\n\n\nso they won’t have my Revolade until Monday\n\n\nbecause it’s a special order.\n\n\nIn 5 years, they’ve never just happened to already have it in stock.\n\n\nAgain, I’m not certain why that is, but can venture a guess\n\n\nthat I’m one of very few, if not the only person\n\n\naround here who’s got it prescribed.\n\n\nThere’s also the matter of cost,\n\n\nwithout the RAMQ\n\n\nor private insurance\n\n\nfooting the bill.\n\n\nAbout 4500$ per 28 days’ supply.\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, a yearly bureaucratic process grants me access with minimal\nmonetary expense. If Revolade were not currently my only viable option,\nI would not be on this drug. Its side-effects &amp; precautions sheet,\nincluded in every box, is the size of a poster, with one side in english\nand the other in french. Some potential side-effects include: cataracts.\nI can’t wrap my head around that one. The prospect of developing\ncataracts, the implication of going “totally blind”, at the age of\n20-something, is not appealing. In practice, that’s not remotely likely\nto happen, so I keep taking the drug.\n\n\n\n\nBut it’s a stroke of luck that I’m fluently bilingual\n\n\nso that I can get anxious in two languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming Sick, Becoming Trans\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I showed a friend some of these writings early on, they said:\n\n\nPicturing you as a protagonist on some wild life ride helps me digest\nthe fact that everything you’re experiencing is real and at times\nscary. I think I would worry far too much otherwise. I hope your\nnewsletter allows you to experience some form of escapism, if only for\na few fleeting moments. How could you not, with all that imagery?\n\n\nI replied:\n\n\nDear Friend, this is not for me a form of escapism.\n\n\nLately, I’ve been experiencing feelings that I don’t yet have the right\nlanguage to describe. Some of what I feel is vigour, passion, lust,\nsorrow, loss. My body feels sore but good, which is an unusual\ncombination for me. I feel connected to the world yet distant. Perhaps\nmost importantly, I feel angrythat the world is so many of the ways that\nit is right now. I feel possessed by rage, which, I’m beginning to\nrealize is at the root of how I choose to be in the world.\n\n\nI feel as though the quote-unquote “sickness” that has shaped my life is\nlittle more than a cultural fiction. I do not mean narrative fiction\nwith political themes. Someone reading a novel or a story can close the\nbook and leave the realm of fiction behind. There is an important\ndifference between cultural fiction and narrative fiction.\n\n\n\n\nCultural fiction is the realm of lived experience formed by all our\nreceived notions of what is and is not possible in reality. It feels as\nthough the words I’ve used to describe myself over the course of my life\nare becoming increasingly senseless. Cultural fiction is the language I\nlearned to use to identify myself with people, groups, categories. Name,\nsex, gender, political status.\n\n\n“How about we all go around and introduce ourselves?\n\n\nLet’s do names, pronouns,\n\n\nand anything else you feel like sharing.”\n\n\nAll of these words are useful short-hand for use on official documents.\nFor many people whose legal identity markers differ in ways from mine,\nthese words are necessary for survival, for recognition and access to\nessential community and services. These Words are not identity. I\nbelieve there is no essential identity, only a shifting set of\nrelations, many of which determine social-political status. I use words\nregularly in order to access medication, credit, lodging; they remain\npolitical fictions. The same system which designates me as Male leads to\nmy diagnosis as Chronically Ill, a nice boy. Politically, I am my\n“deficient” immune system as much as I am a male of legal voting age. In\nactuality, I am not Matthieu-Xavier Marin, though that is the name that\nappears on my passport. I echo here Paul B. Preciado’s words:\n\n\nI am not a man and I am not a woman and I am not heterosexual I am not\nhomosexual I am not bisexual. I am a dissident of the sex-gender system.\nI am the multiplicity of the cosmos trapped in a binary political and\nepistemological system.\n\n\nFor me, being trans is being sick and being sick is being trans. I do\nnot seek medical/legal transition. My gender (or lack thereof) and my\npolitical identity are as real as my illness. My body is already the\nproduct of modern medicine, official Womanhood does not call out to me.\nMy body has been the blood of unknown thousands worldwide, it was the\nPenicillin I took for over a decade, and is the anti-haemorrhage pills I\ntake every day now. I do not want or need synthetic estrogen to cease\nbeing Male, I have long since been in transition. My body has been in\nrevolt against the sex-gender system from the moment my immune system\nwent haywire and began attacking its host: Me.\n\n\n\n\nThe moment a twist of fate blinded one of my eyes I was no longer the\nMale fiction which was assigned to me at birth, I was (and am) A\nPatient. And now, I am learning how to cope with the dis-identification\nfrom masculinity, sickness, and health. There is no escaping these\nfictions which shape my body and yours. Every time I go to a clinic I\nreaffirm the fiction that is Matthieu-Xavier Marin, the fiction of\nmasculinity, the fiction of Immune Thrombocytopenia, all in order to\nreceive treatment which increases my quality of life.\n\n\nWhen the power to withhold treatment may be so quickly brandished, I act\ncounter to my beliefs. If medicine could treat bodies without gendering\nthem, if it were possible to be considered a sovereign political subject\nwithout necessarily being M or F, millions of people would not share my\nproblem. In the current binary system, it is not possible. Honestly, not\nundergoing Official Transition is a form of harm reduction, of not\nmaking more friction for myself.\n\n\nIn naming these things as fiction, I do not deny their material reality.\nBut new fictions must be invented in order to account for the\nmultiplicity of experience.\n\n\nI write it in order to speak. I am writing to engage in dialogue. I am\nwriting with others to redefine what is possible, in order to bring new\nversions of myself into existence. This is an enactment of who I am in\nthe world. It is my way of playing with language until I can find out\nhow to describe and share what my reality consists of. I am speaking the\ndeath of my sick human body, and of the fictions which have shaped my\nworlds, in all the complexity that entails. All this, in order to better\nimagine new possibilities for existing with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotophobia and Blind Gain\n\n\n\n\nTranscription of doctor’s letter, 2001:\nDear Dr. B, RE:M-X MARIN.\n\nFurther to my previous letter regarding this nice little boy, we have\ncontinued to follow him up on a weekly basis. Matthew has becomes very\nlight shy. His examination is quite difficult as a result. Slit lamp\nexamination on the right shows profound corneal staining which has\nworsened since he had a further bleed inside the right eye. On the\nleft sight, the slit lamp examination is difficult.\nNevertheless, I was able to obtain a good view of his cornea, anterior\nchamber, iris, lens and anterior vitreous. There is no suggestion of\nocular inflammation whatsoever. His corneal surface is intact and\nthere is no conjunctival inflammation either. I cannot account for\nMatthew’s symptoms of photophobia. I do not think this is evidence of\nsympathetic ophthalmia. There is a potential risk of this in view of\nhis past history. I have suggested that he continue to use the topical\nVoltaren and Prednisolone 1% drops previously prescribed to the right\neye and that he re-attend in three weeks. I would like to see him\nsooner if his symptomatology worsens.\nKindest regards.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Wikipedia community editors, Photophobia is an abnormal\nintolerance to visual perception of light. It is an experience of\ndiscomfort or pain to the eyes due to light exposure or physical\nsensitivity. When my eye doctor diagnosed my photophobia, they were\nbasing themselves on how I reacted to the bright directional lights used\nfor examination.\n\n\nThe word photophobia can also mean morbid fear of cameras or seeing.\n\n\nIt is aversion, an impulse to recoil from looking.\n\n\nIn my regular life, photophobic days are when I won’t make eye contact,\nleaving the house is less likely to happen, and I can’t concentrate on\nanything.\n\n\nPhotophobia is not unlike a migraine. It’s kinda like seeing multicolour\nTV static on those old bunny-ear sets. Over the years, I had a few eye\nsurgeries to diminish eye-ball pressure. Back when the pressure was\nextremely high, I’d have photophobic days a lot. Lately it’s uncommon.\n\n\nThe only cause I’ve been able to pinpoint for photophobia in my adult\nlife is fatigue. When I am tired, my eyes hurt. A straightforward\nformula. Following months working full-time at a computer, my tolerance\nto screens has diminished significantly, so I rarely watch TV anymore.\n\n\nWhen my eyes are in pain, I use them differently. I’m not equipped for\nnavigating life without sight, I lack practice. Still, my eyes ask that\nI take a break from staring into the world, and learn other ways of\nunderstanding.\n\n\nHow about another reading of photophobia: not as pathological aversion\nto sight, but as revolt against vision by Blindness, as “blind gain.” I\nam inspired by the d/Deaf studies narration of deaf gain rather than\nhearing loss. Deafness and Blindness have been thought of as framing\nexperience. Okay. Whose frame? Who’s doing this framing?\n\n\nFraming is a partial, banal, and unimaginative metaphor about sight. It\nrestricts possibilities outside of “useful vision” by constructing\nborders around possibilities for constellation. “Looking” appears as\njust a tool for knowledge. Unfortunately, this tool is weaponized.\n\n\nSight is a basis of pathology: it creates normality, symptoms.\n\n\nSight bores into reality, to prove it can be seen.\n\n\nVision is a scope for framing reality in your sights, making reality a\nvisible entity open to calculation and marketing. I’m so tired of being\nmarketed at. Vision is predatory, capturing images for language to\nnarrow down by force. Looking has been used to choose the visible and\nconstruct the invisible. It is mobilized to create fear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore one surgery a nurse applied anesthetic goop\n\n\nto your left hand where the IV would go later.\n\n\nI didn’t protest but soon after the solution began acting upon the\nnerves\n\n\nI realized your hand was on its way to disappearing.\n\n\nI had learned not to trust your eyes\n\n\neven as they assured us the hand remained visible.\n\n\n\n\nLooking is a trap. Looking occurs from the outside in.\n\n\nPeering upon the surface of skin of paper of the fire\n\n\nwe see only the surface the folds of visible material.\n\n\nGazing at you is accompanied by the inner sense\n\n\nof flow of blood of breath the pulse if our attention is tuned.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the obsession with microscopy?\n\n\nTired extension of the eye’s desire to sense\n\n\nsurfaces across new territories.\n\n\nHolders of a pair of human eyes cannot\n\n\nthen be content with the sight\n\n\nproffered by you my darling the mostly sighted?\n\n\n\n\nFor years we glued your eye to a viewfinder\n\n\nin the hopes of discovering a new way to capture light.\n\n\nToo late, far too late. The image catalog is overflowing as it is.\n\n\nOkay, we said, and turned the camera on ourself,\n\n\non you, to reshape and mold in static frames what motion only confused.\n\n\nDay and night rearranging that bedroom above Boul. St-Jo\n\n\nto catch the sunlight the lamplight against the blank walls,\n\n\ndreaming of a “real” studio, hardly realizing that\n\n\nspace is not what makes the photograph but indeed it is the eye.\n\n\nFriends asked how I do it and I quipped\n\n\nthat your singular sight holds many secrets.\n\n\nThat’s still true, but photography with its focus on the visible\n\n\ncannot capture the ocular sublime of your optic nerves.\n\n\n\n\nPhotos serve to explore you\n\n\nto find other angles the mirror doesn’t allow,\n\n\nto rip out your eye and relocate it\n\n\n6 feet away where the machine holds the key\n\n\nto new territories of fleshy surfaces\n\n\nenfolded as we find more positions to reveal you\n\n\nand put you on display, on a pedestal of our choosing.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s understand symptoms of vision loss as blind gain,\n\n\nin a conscious shift away from the regime of vision.\n\n\nBlind gain is looking’s move beyond instrumental sight.\n\n\nBlind gain surpasses sight in order to reveal\n\n\nan invisible present within the ongoing moment.\n\n\nBlind gain is the feeling that we have much to learn from sightlessness.\n\n\n\n\nIt is a sensitivity to the harms enacted by vision.\n\n\nIt is a category for imagining beyond sight.\n\n\nIt is an awareness that a shift in perception is a good thing.\n\n\nMy blindness is always changing.\n\n\n\n\nHow come I was told all my life that I had lost vision,\n\nrather than gained blindness?\n\nSome summer days, my blind eye can take the full brunt of the sun.\n\n\nOther days, a dim room or my phone’s screen\n\n\nare enough to force both my eyes closed in defence against the light,\n\n\nso vision can’t really look at anything either.\n\n\nThese are those photophobic days, when blindness revolts.\n\n\nBlind gain creates interference.\n\n\nThe pictures might come through, or not.\n\n\nKnowledge is open to all, and images are not life.\n\n\nTo feel deeply, we must think beyond the visible.\n\n\nThe sensation of flows in my body is enough proof that I am still alive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am troubled by our senses, and sight’s legacy within feeling.\n\n\nWe tend to impose perception rather than feel with honesty.\n\n\n“Framing” so much as the birds we may hear or the earth we lay on.\n\n\nVerily, enframing is sight’s doing, vision’s call to arms.\n\n\nFraming restricts fields of experience, like we have long penned\nanimals:\n\n\nto keep them in sight, under relative control.\n\n\nFrames are borders: geometric and geographic,\n\nimposed by the Eye’s vision.\n\nFraming establishes a relationship of domination\n\nbetween parties meeting upon the field.\n\nGiven that sight is essentially limited, it seeks unseen territories\n\n\nin order to deepen, widen, and stratify its expanse.\n\n\n\n\nSight is a tool, wielded by Power, so that previously-unseen\n\n\nothers may be ensnared and dispossessed by its frames.\n\n\nSight is a barometer of what is allowed within or without,\n\n\nas human or other, white or other,\n\n\nman or other, straight or other, living or dead.\n\n\nSight lacks nuance, even in its waning imperial rule.\n\n\nSight is the trouble we stay with even while learning about\nalternatives.\n\n\nWe’re stuck with it, as seers or seen and often as both. \n\n\n\n\nTransgressive is any act which would break down the frames\n\n\nand create unseen realms of possibility.\n\n\n\n\nBlind gain is an unframing, an unseeing, a re-realizing without borders,\n\n\nwhere we may share with each other what we know and\n\n\nwhat we might use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSickness As A Way Of Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020-04-01\n\n\n\n\nSickness involves learning how the body is remedied and poisoned.\n\nWhen sickness and medicine come together, they create illness. Living\nwell with an ever-present awareness that sickness exists is a learned\npractice. I learned as I grew up in-and-out of hospitals.\n\n\nI am reading The Immune System, A Very Short Introduction, because I do\nnot understand how how the body’s biology works. I’m finding this\nIntroduction scientifically informative, but I’ve got a bone to pick\nwith its language.\n\n\nAs an example, the book’s metaphor for viral infection is of “hijacking”\ncells. To me, that language implies that our cells are private property\nbeing commandeered by a virus and driven off course towards doom. This\nrhetoric of the body seems to make our own bodies unworthy of trust.\nThey must be controlled, bridled like wild horses.\n\n\nDifferent bodies have different claims to ownership, and enact varying\ndegrees of violent repression\n\n\nto maintain ownership over the cells of other bodies. For a Citizen in\n21st century so-called-canada, which I am, the ownership-bid is divided\nup in as many parts as there are calls for us to work productively, or\nencouragements to consume “freely” the fruits of global economic\nproduction shipped to our northern land. This is a soft repression.\n\n\nIn Illness as Metaphor, Susan Sontag dissects the literature concerning\nTuberculosis and Cancer. Pervasive disease of the 18-20th centuries. She\nfinds that a recurring metaphor for Turberculosis is “consumption.”\nConsumption is defined here as a manner of appearing ill. It was\nenvisioned glamorously. Many aristocrats adorned themselves\n“consumptively.” Tuberculosis was fashionable.\n\n\n\n\nFor others in Sontag’s analysis, consumption was viewed as a habit to be\nbroken. In other words: the malady of Tuberculosis itself was a habit.\nIn all cases, Sontag’s metaphors of illness seem concerned with the\nperception of illness in others, with its representation after the fact,\nnot with the lived reality of sickness.\n\n\nSontag herself had 3 cancers, and died with the third. She never\npublished auto-biographical texts in her life. But I took a detour to\nread her early journals, 1947-1963. Poor Susan had no grasp on her\nemotions. She is ruled by them even as she parses out the intellectual\nintricacies of life. These journals take us from ages 16-30 or so. From\nauditing classes at Berkeley, through marriage, early years of her child\nDavid, bohemia in Paris, and life as a young writer in NYC. She’s\nstruggling throughout with How to Love, Be a Jew, Be a Writer. She reads\nwidely and ceaselessly. Voraciously considers her culture, lives it. All\nthe while, the journals are precipitously self-conscious. “How do I\nexist?” A perpetual reflexive self-analysis. Relentless. Sontag never\nonce relaxed in all these 15 years. Her love affairs all strike me as\nchildish. Why? She is entrapped, stuck in co-dependency. She admits in\nthe 60s that she feels rarely able to be alone, that she feels\nun-self-sufficient. She vampirized her lovers. No doubt some of that was\nmutual, but as a reader I saw only S.S’ view. As a reader indeed, the\nexperience was thrilling. The sheer intimacy of it. I dreamt of her last\nnight.\n\n\nSomehow, the ill are read as on their way to death’s door. Sontag’s book\nwas reviewed as an exhilarating “literary” performance, in spite of her\nexplicit point that “illness” is not a metaphor. She was wrong. Susan\nwould have us regard illness in a “healthy” way “purified” of metaphoric\nthinking. Simultaneously, she enforces borders between “Kingdoms of\nhealth and ill.” It seems that, to Sontag, illness broke life into a\nbinary Good and Bad. 40 years later, those alleged borders are radically\nporous. Each of us harbours a near-constant awareness that at any moment\nwe may fall ill and be rendered dependent on others for our ability to\nconsume. Sickness demands that we trust the people around us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean, to trust?\n\n\nHow can we trust our own bodies,\n\n\nlet alone others,\n\n\nwhen a virus is pandemic?\n\n\nHow could we possibly trust,\n\n\nwhen we understand viral infection as an attack,\n\n\na virus as a combatant?\n\n\nWhen we’re always on the defence, shields raised?\n\n\nInstead of virus as hijacker, what about the virus as teacher?\n\n\nFrom a virus, a host body learns to develop anti-bodies with which to\neliminate the infection.\n\n\n\n\nHow many of us now are now unsure what to do with our days,\n\n\nwhen we can hardly produce or consume?\n\n\nHow many of us feel guilty?\n\n\nThis moment is an opportunity to learn other ways\n\n\nof using time and resources.\n\n\nHow many of us are afraid?\n\n\nHow can we defend ourselves against the metaphors of illness and viral\ninfection at once?\n\n\nIllness is an idea, and it is shaped by how we invoke the word.\n\n\nIllness is the stress, fear, restlessness, guilt, and unease we are\nfeeling.\n\n\nIllness is why many of us don’t know what to make of their days.\n\n\n\n\nSickness as a way of life is an ecology of presence,\n\n\nan acceptance of the covenant between our bodies and the earth.\n\n\nWe alive now are not any more guilty for pandemic than climate change,\n\n\nbut we must be responsible for how we respond to both and more.\n\n\n\n\nPopulations have been violently dispossessed of responsibility by the\ndominant order of things,\n\n\nand we are at grips to reclaim our presence on the living earth we\ninhabit.\n\n\nPandemic may serve as disillusionment within apocalypse.\n\n\nWe are here. Not morally or legally bound to responsibility,\n\n\nbut filled with desire to promote renewal, reciprocity, and respect.\n\n\nThis moment is so full of embodied potentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime flows by. Saturdays, I am not turning on my phone or computer.\n\n\nHow much physical isolation is by design? How are ‘safety’ and\n‘productivity’ linked?\n\n\nPandemic is globally a herald for martial law. Public safety restricts\ninterpersonal contact to forms dictated by law so that ‘unsafe’ actions\nmay be limited. Organizing mass physical protest seems unthinkable when\npandemic is rampant. The imposition of public safety over history has\nforced acts of public revolt to assume non-violent forms. “Peaceful\nprotest.” With increased surveillance came increased reliance on\nsubterfuge. There was a move away from violent uprising toward\nideological battle. Peoples were dispossessed of arms so that power may\nkeep them. The disarmament of society and the militarization of policing\nco-operate with the word of law to ensure “safety.”\n\n\nWe rely on ideas to keep us safe rather than the bodies we inhabit, so\nwe have no more arms with which to care for ourselves. How can we take\nresponsibility if no one has taught us how? It is a matter of learning\nhow to be sick.\n\n\n\n\nSickness is a call to collective action.\n\n\nSickness is what families, communities, and affinity groups come\ntogether to care for.\n\n\nSickness is a way of life.\n\n\nIllness is sickness’ ethic reduced to a pathology.\n\n\nIllness is a means to shrug off personal responsibility.\n\n\n\n\nIt removes us from the lived reality of sickness all around.\n\n\nMy sickness is real enough.\n\n\nReal, in that doctors have a name for it.\n\n\nA set of treatments. An agreed-upon scale of severity.\n\n\nReal in fact because it is named, and quantifiable.\n\n\nLittle guesswork remains, there are the facts, the diagnosis.\n\n\nIllness, still, is obscene.\n\n\n\n\nIn conversation, I notice people seem afraid to utter the word pandemic.\n\n\nA rock-star academic already has a book about COVID-19 available for\npre-order.\n\n\n\n\nI feel like a teenager, back when everything was “so sick”,\n\n\neven while illness had long enveloped the entirety of my waking life.\n\n\n\n\nEvery day, I question: what is worth doing right now?\n\n\nCurrently Reading, Writing, Talking, Walking, Dancing,\n\n\nCycling, Tai chi, Qi-Gong, Meditating, Cooking, Sleeping,\n\n\nPlaying and Watching by myself and with myself, Photography\n\n\nare all worth doing for me.\n\n\n\n\nI have learned that an excess of self-discipline is no substitute for\nspontaneity and joy,\n\n\nso I smoke cannabis because it helps me feel better and more\ncontemplative.\n\n\n\n\nI live alone with support, and I am screen-averse.\n\n\nThis is a difficult combination right now,\n\n\nwhen a breach in loneliness comes mostly through the internet.\n\n\nI have felt guilty for my own improved well-being amidst pandemic.\n\n\nHow is it that I should feel in may ways\n\n\nbetter than two weeks ago?\n\n\nSo many others are suffering right now.\n\n\nYet I have more energy, more willpower,\n\n\nand a renewed sense of purpose.\n\n\nDaily my desire to create grows.\n\n\nI feel more present in the world now than I ever have.\n\n\n\n\nThe apartment I rent houses me alone.\n\n\nI do not wake up or sleep near others right now.\n\n\nMy days are mostly devoted to contemplation.\n\n\nI am supported in making sure my material needs are met.\n\n\nFor me, the radical slow-down of daily life\n\n\nhas been a deeply positive thing.\n\n\nMy awareness of current-global-events has narrowed.\n\n\nI only really follow certain local developments.\n\n\nI know the rest of the news-cycle exists too,\n\n\nbut since I don’t seek it out,\n\n\nit rarely comes to me by accident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaying around my home and limiting commercial contact\n\n\nhas allowed me to devote far more time to resting.\n\n\n\n\nDoesn’t anyone else find Rest difficult to come by when daily routine\ninvolves commuting and working among hundreds and thousands of others?\nThe press of city life is exhausting and driven by an excess of\naccumulation and commerce.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s honestly far more pleasant to stay home.\n\n\nHere, I feel control over the ideas that direct my life.\n\n\nI can unplug my clock, and suddenly time is radically changed for me.\n\n\nThe mot-d’ordre ceases to be.\n\n\nI’m suddenly aware my rhythm is in tune with the rising and setting sun,\n\n\nrather than the numbers on the dial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Matter\n\n\n2020-04-08\n\n\n\n\nI live for myself. How could it be any other way?\n\nI am selfish. I acknowledge that within my own life, my wellbeing comes\nfirst. It is by keeping myself alive that I can best support others.\nThose I love, who turn to me for support, I want to be there for them.\nIf I do not do what I must in order to feel good and whole within\nmyself, I cannot sustainably support others. Our lives, intertwined, I\ndo not wish them extirpated, no matter what the government regulations\nstipulate. I want to enmesh us further, to know what comes of closeness.\nTo do this, we must learn when to say ‘No. Enough. Not right now.’\n\n\nThis is not up to authority to determine, it is individual\nresponsibility. So long as I am able, I will turn this ability into\ngood. I am no better or worse than anyone else. Each of us is here, and\nlearning what that means. How can anyone possibly presume to know what’s\nbest for another person? We all have different answers. I tend my own\ngarden and share the harvest. I strive to glean carefully what each\nworld-fragment has to share. To recognize and shed prejudice, gather\neach thing on its own as a whole part of the larger universe.\n\n\nDaily I take stock of my capacity. Variability and fluctuation unlike\never before. Or perhaps I’m just more perceptive. I’ve been in a more\npersonally tumultuous state before. Now, the tumult is outside. My inner\nlife is relatively calm. I notice its intricacies in more detail, it is\nwith both apprehension and excitement that I write down my dreams. I aim\nto Stop expecting a text back. Stop demanding a response. Each of us is\noverwhelmed by demands on our attention. Forget any notion that you are\nmore important than any one else. I am not any more important than\nanyone else, don’t get back to me if you don’t have the energy, and\nplease do not feel guilty. Everyone on earth, without exception, is part\nof what is underway ever after this state of limbo.\n\n\n\n\nShare what matters to you, far and wide, regardless of expectation. Make\nno demands on the energy of others unbidden, but do not be afraid to\nshare. What is it that is keeping you going right now? No matter how\nbenign, someone else empathizes. Our ideas must flow with compassion. We\nfeel the way together.\n\n\nHow do I feel? I feel my feet cocooned in thin socks, intimately\nfamiliar with the old wood floor. I know the floor’s dips and inclines,\nfor having stood alone with it. I feel my window facing 120 degrees SE,\nif my dusty old compass is to be believed. I feel the sun’s rays rising\nthrough the southeasterly portal. I’ve cracked it open, so I’m stroked\nby spring breeze and I hear spring sound. I feel excitement and\ndetermination, as I focus on my projects.\n\n\nI feel the air I breathe, and I feel the tightness of anxiety in my\nlungs.\n\n\nI feel both my eyes distinct from one another.\n\n\nI feel the nerves sprouting from the skull’s base, connecting me.\n\n\nI see the sun on my skin and sense pleasant warmth.\n\n\nI bear a light ache in my heart as sad thoughts of distant separation\ncome to mind.\n\n\nI pause, and read a paragraph from Phèdre aloud to myself.\n\n\nUnable to digest more than that at once, I lay the book back down on my\ndesk.\n\n\nPlato’s Socrates is opposed to allegorical interpretation of the world.\n\n\nFollowing the Oracle at Delphi’s guidance, he chooses to focus on\nlearning himself.\n\n\n\n\nAnd who do I presume to be? One whose voice rings clear within the\ndepths of my own flesh. A body is anything but transparent, I contain\nfar more than the sum of my parts. Each action I take for my own\nwellbeing drives me forward toward a higher version of myself.\nCompleting even the most benign tasks is part of the puzzle. Self-care\nis primordial. I love this world. I love existing with/in it. I love its\nsimplicity and complexities. The wellspring of sensation runs deeper\nthan I can ever know. All my efforts to feel deeply spiral together,\nsharper and deeper, plunging my body into itself. I leave aside\npreconceptions about what it is possible for me to feel, and take\nnew/familiar sensations as they come, not disbelieving my own grasp of\nreality. Why should I ever tell myself a feeling is false? I am blessed\nwith an honest body, one which attempts no trickery. It is with time and\npatience that I learn the grammar of sensation. There is no formula for\nlove, there is only acknowledgement of its possibility and dedication to\nits practice. Love is a choice.\n\n\nInner life is inherently true, there is no contradicting solipsistic\nexperience. Inner life risks becoming false when it butts up against the\nouter world and its many contradictions, yet the truth of inner life\ndoes not make it serene. Truth can be chaos, hurt, confusion. It is\nthrough acceptance that I begin to make sense of my truth. Facing\nunpleasant truth is difficult. It’s much simpler to focus only on\npositives, to live as though everything ought to be pleasurable all the\ntime. Even now, there are so many positives.\n\n\nFocusing on pain is a necessary means of better understanding my place\nin the world, my relationship to my past, my needs in the present, and\nmy desire for a future. Not those material wants which lend themselves\nto a certain lifestyle, but the needs of which drive me.\n\n\nSo many questions from disparate sources with ongoing answers: What is\nthe capacity for violence? What do we harness, to grow in power? Who are\nwe? How can we be meaningfully frightened? What happens when the\ntemporarily-able-bodied, the not-ill, begin to roam again? What is the\nvalue of escape in living with presence? How do we balance Here+Now with\nThen+There in order to survive pandemic’s emotional toll? What is it\nabout stories of unreal proportions that feel so liberating?\n\n\n\n\nStorytelling is freedom-making. The reading of stories is a cure for\nloneliness and it is an amnesiac. Reading is a matter of embodying the\nreality suggested in the text. There is a great beauty in this temporary\ncommandeering of memory. Give up on courage, and escape. How wonderful,\nthat I might ignore human suffering for a time, and empathize with\nnarrative fiction instead. Draped in its own fictions, waking life hurts\nme to bear. So much is wrong and so much is uncertain. In re-reading a\nfamiliar story, I can suspend my knowledge of how much I do not know\nhere and now, to indulge in knowing some future, and strap into the\ntumult leading up to an ending.\n\n\nFor there is an end, even to 3000 page sagas. The printed page is\nfloriously static. It does not risk slipping into new terrifying realms\nof as-yet-unimagined unknowns. I have picked a narrative I know, I am\nfamiliar with the arc upon which I will fly. And there, escaping into\nother identities, I find comfort.\n\n\nThere is no going back to normal.\n\n\nNormal?\n\n\nNormal as in healthy?\n\n\nThere can be no going back because what pandemic reveals is the fiction\nof health. We have never been healthy. Health is a story woven by\ninstitutional power in order to create a reality in which it is possible\nto negate certain lives on the basis of abnormality or pathology.\n\n\nPandemic extends the logic of medicalization to everyone. Prevention is\ncurrently the treatment preached by the government of canada, so that we\nmay slow the spread of COVID-19 and not overwhelm our public healthcare\ninfrastructure.

Coronavirus has brought fever into sharp relief as a symptom.\nFever, for all its utility, is a source of fear.\n\n\n\nSeptember 2001\n\n\nI am the first laparoscopy-splenectomy patient\n\n\nat BC children’s hospital in Vancouver.\n\n\nFor half a chance of inducing ITP remission,\n\n\nI undergo surgery to remove my spleen.\n\n\nLaparoscopy is a minute procedure consisting\n\n\nof many small incisions\n\n\nfor the entry of surgical tools;\n\n\ncameras, suction tubes, knives.\n\n\nIt’s an alternative to open gut surgery\n\n\nwith less obvious marks left on the body’s surface.\n\n\nYour scars are barely noticeable\n\n\nif you don’t know to look,\n\n\nor if fingers aren’t searching.\n\n\nThe procedure separates surgeon from patient with a camera,\n\n\nextending the careful eye for steady hands.\n\n\nDoctor doesn’t get to peer directly\n\n\ninto patient and examine the organs firsthand,\n\n\nmust trust that the camera feed\n\n\nis an accurate depiction of the body.\n\n\nAnd why wouldn’t it be?\n\n\nThe lens and the sensor are trusted\n\n\nsources of fact, or so the story goes.\n\n\nBiologically, the spleen is a sort of filter for blood.\n\n\nIt’s not all that vital until you get an infection,\n\n\nat which point it is a very useful line of defence.\n\n\nSpleen removal is a common treatment\n\n\nfor Immune Thrombocytopenia,\n\n\nbecause the spleen occasionally destroys too many platelets.\n\n\nFor me, it induced a partial and temporary remission\n\n\nthat left me taking oral penicillin tablets\n\n\ndaily to kill off infectious bacteria.\n\n\n(no one thought back then of antibiotics abuse, overprescription)\n\n\nWhen I was little I couldn’t swallow the pill\n\n\nso maman crushed it up with a mortar and pestle\n\n\nI swigged it with orange juice, juice or water,\n\n\ngot a treat afterwards.\n\n\nGummy bears. Positive Reinforcement.\n\n\nDoctor’s Orders Better Safe Than Sorry.\n\n\nDespite the antibiotics, we regularly rushed\n\n\nto the hospital in the middle of the night.\n\n\nThe problem with not having a spleen\n\n\nis the speed at which an infection might turn deadly.\n\n\nThat’s why, when I have a fever of 38.5C I go to the ER.\n\n\nUsually it’s just the flu.\n\n\nWhen my immune system starts doing its job\n\n\n— eliminating infection —\n\n\nit also remembers just how much\n\n\nit despises my blood platelets.\n\n\nThe result is that any infection\n\n\nleaves me with dangerously low platelet counts,\n\n\nsometimes in the range of\n\n\n“may spontaneously bleed internally.”\n\n\nI am not afforded the possibility of waiting it out\n\n\nand seeing whether my condition improves on its own.\n\n\nYeah odds are it’s fine i’ll just sleep it off\n\n\nbut what if it isn’t?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH1N1, 2009\n\n\nI didn’t get the vaccine\n\n\nand wasn’t alive for the 1918 outbreak.\n\n\nNo antibodies, so I catch swine flu late June.\n\n\n40C fever near delirious in Ottawa children’s hospital bed,\n\n\nI remember my friends were on a school trip to Toronto\n\n\nstrapped in to roller-coasters at an amusement park to experience\nexcessive g-force.\n\n\nI may have played video games, I’m not sure, I don’t remember.\n\n\nI created my first Runescace account in 2006, I was 10 years old. I’d\nplay in the couple hours waiting for test results before the doctor’s\nvisit. I think I found it because it was popular on Miniclip. The\nsoundtrack, the world, the slow pace; Runescape is a waiting game. I\nremember discovering my player character’s limits heading West, followed\nby an in-game pal. “Where are we going?” “To find the elves.” —only,\nthe elves are pay-walled. Eventually, I convinced Maman to pay my\nmembership fee, but I never progressed through to the elven settlement.\nA simple structure: Quests, levels, trading, combat. Goals to reach.\nPower to gain. Every attainment felt hard-earned in its reward. The\ncommunity, active and friendly back then, seemed to be composed mostly\nof other kids around my age. Now, I guess it’s probably mostly adults on\na nostalgia trip.\n\n\nThe point-and-click adventure in waiting. Waiting for the trees to grow.\nWaiting for adversaries to spawn, waiting for mineral ore to appear in\nthe rocks. RS’ world is scaled up to a speed that keeps players waiting,\nbut not too long. Not so long that progress feels halted. Cycles are\nquick enough for us to sit at the computer with baited breath, eagerly\nawaiting the next clic. And what’s more, it a resource is too crowded, a\nhundred parallel worlds are available.\n\n\n\n\nWaiting can be circumvented. The player is afforded enough control and\npower that the actions in game feel like meaningful progress.\n\n\nIt is the ideal game for limbo.\n\n\nIn pandemic, 4 friends and I got back into the game. “I’ve always wanted\naccess to this content” says one about the members-only stuff. Now a\nwork-from-home graphic designer, what better way to escape the condo of\nthe 50th floor above Toronto than into Gelienor? The so-called\nreal-world is stuck, we have no control, so the desire to make progress\nis well-suited to the game.\n\n\nRunescape accomplishes nothing useful. And how glorious, that nothing is\nproductive. No personal growth, no professional development, no\nupskilling. It can be said that playing an MMORPG is refusal to\ncapitalize on leisure time. A queer use of time; failure to behave.\nSimple indulgence in a designer world with quantifiable barometers of\nprogress that are attainable to any player willing to put in the\nnecessary time.\n\n\nI probably played it during my H1N1 infection, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer 2012\n\n\na lethal heatwave sweeps north America\n\n\nbut Maman and I are on vacation in Europe.\n\n\nI think it’s the second or third time I’m over there\n\n\nI’m having fun but I miss my girlfriend.\n\n\nIn Paris I took lots of rainy pictures\n\n\nwith a camera my high school teacher lent me for the summer.\n\n\nWe leave Paris by TGV to Montreux, Suisse.\n\n\nAfter a couple of days in bourgeois paradise\n\n\nwe drive up to visit friends in Château-d’Œx,\n\n\nfamous for its Balloon Week.\n\n\nI’m fine when we set out on the road\n\n\nbut after lunch I start feeling ill\n\n\nand am feverish by the time we make it\n\n\nto Maman’s friend’s home.\n\n\nWe think I’m just tired so I go to sleep\n\n\nafter taking a picture.\n\n\n\n\nDescription of Image taken in the Swiss alps, July 2012:\n\n\nForeground of verdant field leading up to a large wooden cabin\noverlooking a hill, with bright green window shutters open but windows\nclosed and white curtains pulled. Further afield on the other side of\na second grassy hill, dense forest hugs the mountain slopes partially\nlit by sun as cloud-shade cuts across. Background of mountainous peaks\nsparsely wooded against cloudy sky of cotton-candy clouds.\n\n\n\n\nI don’t have a solid grasp of how much time passes.\n\n\nI play that old Pandemic 2 flash game\n\n\nin a fever haze on a slow ethernet\n\n\nconnection in the swiss alps.\n\n\nSomething catches my eye on screen\n\n\nVirtual September 2008:\n\n\n- first victim dies in china\n\n\n- china begins burning bodies to prevent infection.\n\n\nI take a screenshot,\n\n\nhighlight the back-to-back event dialogs,\n\n\nmake a post ironically titled\n\n\n“Boy, that escalated quickly”\n\n\nand get 537 comments.\n\n\n\n\nMy bedsheets are changed regularly as I sweat profusely\n\n\nthe adults decide it’s time to get me to a hospital\n\n\nwhen blood shows up in my stoole.\n\n\nThe friend we’re staying with is a healer.\n\n\nOne afternoon I sit shivering across from her and we talk.\n\n\nShe peers into my 15 year old eyes and\n\n\nreveals to me my own fear of death.\n\n\nShe doesn’t have the medicine to stop the bleeding\n\n\nbut we hug and I feel impending doom leave my body\n\n\nin a rush of cathartic relief\n\n\nI’m hyperventilating \n\n\nmy lips quiver like my pulse is wholly\n\n\ncontained in that patch of split pink\n\n\nI can’t speak I try to breathe\n\n\nmy head rushes with light and the world implodes.\n\n\nI come back to my body slow and suddenly I’m aware\n\n\nof sunshine through wide windows in a room full of books.\n\n\nMaman and I take a small mountain train back to Montreux\n\n\nit’s a beautiful day and I devote my time\n\n\nin peaceful delirium to wondering\n\n\nwhat death feels like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall-town doctor says they don’t have the meds I need\n\n\nbut they do a blood test anyway\n\n\nso that the results might be in sooner.\n\n\nSoon enough, I’m in on a stretcher\n\n\nin an ambulance on a highway watching\n\n\nthe swiss scenery go by\n\n\nout the back window there’s not a lot of traffic.\n\n\nMaman is scared but relieved\n\n\nthat the travel insurance is taking care of the bill.\n\n\nI spend a night or two in Lausanne’s\n\n\nhigh-tech university hospital\n\n\nthere’s WiFi so really I’m decently happy.\n\n\nThe nurse takes my electronic music\n\n\nrecommendations before I check out\n\n\nI’m well enough to get on a plane so we fly back to Ottawa\n\n\nand to this day we do not know what I caught in the mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring 2017\n\n\nDreamt I’m strutting across the lobby of a hotel where I work retail,\n\n\npass the co-working space the bar the pool table and push aside\n\n\nthe hardwood door to one of the binary water closets.\n\n\nFind the room padded with sweltering black velvet walls floor ceiling\n\n\nall black all soft\n\n\nI begin to melt as I walk forward in a vain attempt\n\nto relieve myself in black porcelain\n\nbut instead I woke up to find my bed soaked in sweat.\n\n\nI take my temperature for the second time that night — 38.6C.\n\n\nI tried to keep the temp. down with acetaminophen\n\n\nbut I only delayed the inevitable.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s 2am, I gather up my necessities and take the night-bus south\n\n\nto l’Hôpital Notre-Dame because I’m too broke for a cab\n\n\nMaman is in another country for a conference.\n\n\nCalmly waltz into the ER take a number wait my turn, they’ve got my\nfile.\n\n\nEarlier that night I tried to lie to myself like\n\n\noh im just dehydrated i shouldn’t have had that last beer\n\n\nbut I felt fever’s omens before going to bed.\n\n\nFirst few years at conc-University basically each did the same thing to\nme\n\n\nI overworked underslept and ignored my body’s desire for rest\n\n\nuntil it was time to check in as a patient.\n\n\nWhisked through admissions they’ve got me in a bed\n\n\nan IV drip of broad-spectrum antibiotics and saline\n\n\nto keep me hydrated although No, we don’t know what I’ve caught.\n\n\nWhatever, fine, do a blood test a blood culture try to figure it out\n\nif it matters.\n\nI’m there a couple of days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack home, we burned your feet by spilling scalding golden tea that\nMaman had just handed over.\n\n\nShe’d gotten back that day from a trip abroad, a conference in Vegas,\n\n\nand I’d gotten home that day from hospitalization,\n\n\na couple of days at Notre-Dame.\n\n\nThat was the month I first read Sontag On Photography\n\n\nas well as the time my partner was mistaken for my sibling at bedside.\n\n\nIt was the summer I decided to try shooting film\n\n\nand I still haven’t developed all the rolls.\n\n\nI actually ended up burning the undeveloped rolls.\n\n\nIt’s the time, the only time, I asked the nurse if I could snapshot the\nIV being needled in.\n\n\nSo I’d just gotten home and Maman as well, from different journeys.\n\n\nScalding flesh with water I tore off the jeans I was wearing (I still\nwear that pair)\n\n\nand sat on the bed, looking up the right course of action on wikihow.\n\n\nSoaked my feet in lukewarm water but realized pretty fast\n\n\nas the bubbles formed on skin\n\n\nthat a doctor should probably have a look at this\n\n\nso maman helped me stumble to her car and we drove back to the hospital\n\n\nI had walked home from earlier the same day through MTL\n\n\nverdant spring holding hands feeling lively and fucking my friend\n\n\nwho was leaving for Toronto that afternoon.\n\n\nIn the interval between sex and getting burned\n\n\nI finished Sontag and decided to keep taking pictures\n\n\nbecause that seemed like a worthy endeavour.\n\n\n\n\nBack at the ER the nice doctor prescribes me morphine\n\n\nbut I smoke tea instead.\n\n\nPlatelet counts way too low, time to take a month off work\n\n\ndefer some exams and visit some family.\n\n\nPlatelets, for the uninitiated reader,\n\n\nare a component of blood generated in bone marrow\n\n\nthat serve to clot blood and heal wounds.\n\n\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n\nlacking platelets, we bleed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing Air\n\n\n2020-05-05\n\n\n\n\nIn the midst of pandemic\n\nI have gone on some walks, sat in some municipal parks.\n\n\nOther people breathe nearby. I wonder where they’ve been recently.\n\n\nHow many of them bring a hospital’s airspace with them to the park?\n\n\nJust out of the allotted physical range,\n\n\nI’m aware that they are also breathing.\n\n\nThey talk and laugh and drink and smoke sometimes\n\n\nmaking the wind visible for a moment,\n\n\ninhale and exhale with the world atmosphere.\n\n\nWind catches my pores\n\n\ncarries my body dust along with each of yours\n\n\nso we conspire regardless of distance,\n\n\nbridging vast expanses across nothingness\n\n\nin order to be together.\n\n\n\n\nI live very far from the front lines.\n\n\nI don’t know what it’s like to live with combat nearby.\n\n\nAll I know of such places has come to me through images videos words,\n\n\nmost of my senses are spared the ample truth: the smells, the shock.\n\n\nI know only a fantasy, fictitious war.\n\n\nYet war and I share an atmosphere.\n\n\nWe breathe within one another.\n\n\nMy breath whispers: How simple, inhale exhale over again\n\nthe first to last thing we’ll ever do.\n\nIt’s the repetition that counts, one breath is nothing for the body, we\nneed air uncounted yet we account for a chemical regime, a specialized\ndiet of far more than oxygen which is poison anyway in overdose. The air\nwe share is a floating, transparent pharmacy not-so-carefully\ncalibrated, and precisely weaponized.\n\n\n\n\nPlease welcome the medics wherever there is fighting.\n\n\nWhat is there to gain from the veritable assault on human sensory\ncapacity, from mass death? I desire counter-offensive measures, but who\ndoesn’t? Anyone whose ever been hurt has tried retaliation, tried\nhurting back. Lately my reading has taken me into potential histories\nwhere men still wreak havoc, but others resist.\n\n\nThe air we share is risky, so we determine how much risk we’re willing\nto handle at a given moment. I conspire to emit air which filters out\nsuffering and positively impact any brief encounter. I share the results\nwith the inevitable passersby no matter which precautions we take. I\nwear a mask in public indoors and in close quarters but have given up on\nmasking myself for a stroll to the park.\n\n\nMy body is trying its best with what it knows of the long-winded lie\nthat is that there is self and there is other. I trust the precautions I\nam taking are enough for me and those I interact with. I trust the air\nwith my immune system. But I do not trust my body to visit a hospital\nright now. I am angry that it has to be this way, and I am scared. I do\nnot know what happens to my body when the numbers stop determining how\nit exists, but I do not want to measure the passing of time with numbers\nand test results.\n\n\nMy partner brings their world to me and we share stories whispering back\nand forth of then there here now conspiring liquid atmospheric\ncoalitions brewing. Limbo feels longer and shorter every single day.\nBreathing is a reminder of life as well as a way of giving thanks. Over\nfacebook messenger I ask my estranged father what worries him right now.\nHow many people will die, are dying, he says.\n\n\nI choose to continue sharing air. Circumstances may make that difficult\nor impossible. I choose this consciously, so I do not bow before\ninevitability. The inevitable does not rule me. Why should it? I treat\nthose inevitabilities I have learned as parts of the air and blood\nstreams.\n\n\nTouch screams, loud, when the body feels unknown skin. Brushed up\nagainst a cashier’s hand as they hand me a receipt, their mouth beyond\nthe counter’s plastic shielding. Our breaths shouldn’t mingle,\n\n\nI’m wearing a mask and hopefully they are too. Surface boundaries are\ntricky. Skin keeps the blood in, but it doesn’t keep the world out.\nAtunement to lived bodies has shifted.\n\n\n\n\nStating the obvious helps me stay grounded I guess,\n\n\nI think it’s because I’m used to my life-force being a numbers game.\n\n\nYou know, like stats in an RPG.\n\n\nTrying to min-max numbers to attain optimal efficiency.\n\n\nWe’re basically machines anyway right\n\n\nlike, so many dudes have said that\n\n\nseems ridiculous though idk.\n\n\nI think we’re more like mycelia\n\n\nor maybe trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Little Golden Cat\n\n\n2020-05-13\n\n\n\n\n\nMae slides by and I sense the displaced air,\n\n\na noticeable shift in housebound stillness.\n\n\nI do nothing but breathe and pick up the\n\n\ncharge of 2 human bodies\n\n\namidst home appliances and neighbours hidden away by walls.\n\n\nI’m lucky when I discern her specific scent from the others,\n\n\nwhen my sense of smell isn’t distracted by some noise.\n\n\nIf the fridge hums I can’t make her out.\n\n\nAbove the stove there’s one of those golden plastic cats\n\n\nwhose arm waves metronomically\n\n\nwith a little solar cell panel.\n\n\nA plastic Maneki-neko souvenir trinket.\n\n\nA seated cat, a bib around its neck, a bell or two,\n\n\na bastardized Japanese koban coin, a paw raised.\n\n\n\n\nLiterally a “beckoning cat,” the swinging arm’s\n\n\ntick-tacks are always audible,\n\n\nlike a clock that announces no time in particular when I deign to look\nover\n\n\nbut rather speaks only to its own presence\n\non that stove here in so-called montreal.\n\nI don’t know whether the cat ever stops beckoning a timeless now.\n\n\nAll it seems to accomplish is a reminder\n\nthat the old stove’s analog time-set is dysfunctional.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe iconic beckoning cat appears to have originated\n\n\nin the late Edo period, feudal japan,\n\n\nand can now be acquired wholesale on Alibaba at the astonishing rate\n\n\nof up to five-hundred-thousand units per month, shipped out of Xiamen,\n\n\na city in the southeastern China beside the Taiwan Strait.\n\n\nThe Maneki-neko in this apartment was manufactured in China,\n\n\npassed quality control and imported to America,\n\n\nso say the embossments and sticker on the bottom,\n\n\nbefore being purchased and turned into a souvenir in this home.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 2 screws in the base that let me take it apart\n\n\nso I do, in the hopes that peering into the lucky cat’s innards will\nreveal\n\n\nsomething essential about the nature of time itself.\n\n\nWhat I find instead of a hollow metaphor\n\n\nis another series of plastic and metal components that come together\n\n\nto make up the swinging arm mechanism.\n\n\n\n\nLikely harvested anywhere on earth, mined out of deep\n\n\ntime’s accretion in the dirt and forged\n\n\nout of globalized myth—the golden cat is storied.\n\n\nThe Maneki-neko is a symbol of good fortune,\n\n\narising out of a story involving a destitute shop/temple/inn;\n\n\nthe poor proprietors take in a hungry and neglected cat.\n\n\nAfter being cared for and loved, the cat ventures out front,\n\n\nsits there and beckons to passers-by,\n\n\nthus shifting the fortunes of the establishment and bringing prosperity.\n\n\n\n\nWhose idea was this cultural export?\n\n\nDid they grow up with their own cherished cats either animate or carved?\n\n\nEither way they turned around and sold\n\n\nmyth down the river for capital gain\n\n\nbecause it seemed the logical thing to do.\n\n\n\n\nI don’t blame them but that doesn’t stop me\n\n\nfrom despising the swinging arm\n\n\nsometimes when I’m just breathing but then\n\n\nits tack tick tack tick sticks\n\n\nto my eardrum and I can’t shake off\n\n\nthis little cat’s little hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI mention to Mae that I’m writing about this cat and learn\n\n\napparently she bought it years ago in NYC chinatown\n\n\nwhen roaming the streets as tourists with friends.\n\n\nOne of them was leading the group astray\n\n\neveryone was frustrated but ultimately souvenirs were purchased,\n\n\npacked up in suitcases, brought back to NB\n\n\nand eventually moved to MTL.\n\n\nSo the cat is here, from everywhere, signalling no time at all.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes when I’m lucky I lose my sense of object permanence.\n\n\nOut of willful forgetfulness comes a void full of nothing from which to\nlearn.\n\n\nThings fade in and out of thingness and cease their clutter.\n\n\nFor a time I get to forget what surrounds me, some of it,\n\n\nbreathe as if I weren’t aware that the objects that inhabit my\nday-to-day\n\n\nare fragments displaced from the earth entire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSympathie Sanguine\n\n\n2020-05-31\n\n\n\n\nBloodiness is a magnetism, an earthiness.\n\nObserving my own arms the veins are hills and tunnels. They bulge and\nrecess in turn. It’s commonplace for a nurse in a talkative mood to\ncomment on their quality.\n\n\nExpert appraisal has it: my veins are ripe for harvest.\n\n\nNot that any of us are too eager.\n\n\nNurses are labouring, sticking needles into veins\n\n\nfor days on end.\n\n\nMost nurses are highly skilled at this task.\n\n\nIt barely hurts. Commendable.\n\n\nI’m trying to imagine my own blood.\n\n\nCreate chances to hear it.\n\n\nRemembering follows loss, memory is split fragments\n\n\nreassembled in a whole different reality.\n\n\nBlood is a form of gravity.\n\n\nI’ll go back to the beginning.\n\n\n\n\nThe first blood test I remember came soon after blind gain.\n\n\nI was 5 years old at British Columbia Children’s hospital.\n\n\nThe blood draw clinic was a couple floors up from the hospital lobby.\n\n\nThe lobby had this massive plastic tree in it. Like 3 stories tall.\n\n\nWe took the elevator up and upon exit there were a series of signs to\nfollow.\n\n\nAll the walls on this level were painted sky blue\nand decorated with flying creatures, bears in aeroplanes,\nclouds rainbows sunshine you know, the usual hospital festivity.\n\n\nSo we follow the party to the clinic.\n\n\nWaiting room was pretty small, maybe 40 chairs.\n\n\nBlue walls. A TV somewhere in the corner.\n\n\nPulp magazines for parents to pretend-read.\n\n\nToys laid out on a table.\n\n\nArrival and check-in, a little window in the wall\n\n\nnext to a door through which we’d soon pass.\n\n\nWe, being myself, Maman,\n\n\nthe other kids and parents waiting.\n\n\nThe first time, I just sat there\n\n\nnot cognizant of what was about to happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy feet didn’t reach the floor\n\n\nmaybe my legs were too short or the chair’s too long.\n\n\nSwung back-forth in ignorant anticipation or maybe simple boredom.\n\n\nWaiting rooms used to elicit boredom for me.\n\n\nI probably stared at the television,\n\n\nthe best way to forget a body before smartphones.\n\n\nI’ve noticed that most hospital waiting rooms\n\n\ndon’t have TV shows on anymore.\n\n\nAnd they don’t call people out by name.\n\n\nMaybe in the children’s hospitals they still do.\n\n\nAt the CHUM the teevees just have numbers on them\n\n\nand every time the numbers change there’s a Ding\n\n\nso everyone looks up\n\n\nonly to dash the patient hopes of all\n\n\nexcept one bored soul whose turn it finally is.\n\n\nAnyway at BC children’s in 2001\n\n\nthey called me by name and we passed into the back room,\n\n\nthrough a doorway, and then another,\n\n\neach room lined with stations\n\n\nhaving all the fixings needed for sanitary\n\n\nblood sample harvest.\n\n\nI’m led to the deepest section\n\n\nof blue-walled-room and sat in a too-big LUMEX\n\n\ndesigned for maximum clinical comfort.\n\n\nIt dawns on me why we’re here.\n\n\nWhile the nurse explains the procedure,\n\n\nI scream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore blood was medicine it was earth\n\n\nborn of generations sowing their seeds.\n\n\nFor all the talk of purity,\n\n\nco-mingling is the way of the world.\n\n\nAssume that blood itself exists in superposition\n\n\nand that blood is the locus of spirit.\n\n\nA mode of transition, transportation,\n\n\ntransmission, diffraction.\n\n\nIn the dirt, blood learns what comes of experimentation.\n\n\nAccording to Hebrew scripture,\n\n\nthe very life of the creature is in the blood.\n\n\n\n\nUn flot vivant cette boueuse rivière rouge pleine d’esprit.\n\n\nCela serait une grave erreur de penser que les histoires que chuchotent\nle sang sont sans conflits. Le sang de la mère française-anglaise, du\nsoi-disant Québec, porte des siècles de vie coloniale, cette violence.\nPar le sang du père Israélien juif d’ascendance Ashkenazi, la souffrance\ndu peuple découle.

Security guards mill about,\n\n\na nondescript hospital employee guides people where they need to go.\n\n\nDo you have an appointment? Where are you headed?\n\nCentre Intégré de Cancérologie, 14th floor,\nI’ve got a blood test today.\n\n\n\nOh, you know you have a separate entrance and elevators right?\n\n\nHere, this way, come with me.\n\n\nBy coming in through there, you won’t have to wander\n\n\nthe entire hospital or touch stuff that’s “disinfected”\n\n\nthough no one really cleans it.\n\n\nThank you, I say, and ponder the horror of that last statement as I\ndisinfect my hands again though I haven’t touched anything and make my\nway to the Oncology-Elevators. Two of us are whisked up in a\nsocially-distanced elevator ride. Maximum occupancy of 4, one person per\nfloor-sticker.\n\n\n\n\nUpstairs I am greeted by a nurse who asks the usual symptom-probes.\n\n\nThe nurse’s right hand brushes up against my palms as she leans in\n\n\nto spray sanitizer and disinfect me once more.\n\n\nI didn’t even press the elevator buttons.\n\n\nA volunteer in a polka-dot bow-tie\n\n\nwalks me down the long waiting room\n\n\nto point out the blood work reception desk,\n\n\nwhich has not moved in the 6 months since I was last here.\n\n\nI was supposed to return sooner, of course.\n\n\n\n\nThey’ve been working on adding a third even taller wing to the CHUM. In\nthe waiting room I always look down at the progress. Almost done now.\nNot just another hole in the ground.\n\n\nI used to get my blood tests done at Notre-Dame, an old old hospital on\nSherbrooke, opened in 1880. The CHUM, built in 2017, has another high\ncapacity blood-draw clinic on the main floor of D-wing, but I’ve never\nsat there in that glass box within the heart of the skyscraper complex\nwith no view outside for patients. For some reason I take the elevator\nto Oncology.\n\n\nOnce though I stayed overnight at the Nouveau-CHUM in an ER hallway on a\ncot under fluorescents. It was mid-march of 2019. I sat in receptive\nsilence, half-lotus, eyes closed, listening, not sleeping. Notice, the\noverworked nurses are torn between the desire to provide comfort and the\nexpectation of staying back, respecting the distance imposed by pain, by\nsickness. How does it feel to have disease constantly on your mind?\nEvery conversation I’ve had in the past week has either been about\nillness or violence.\n\n\nIn the morning my managing haematologist was on duty and came to see me\nat bedside.\n\n\nI said I’m fine.\n\n\nHe said\n\n\nYou’re not fine listen to these numbers.\n\n\nWe’ll up your dose of Revolade\n\n\nDeliver intravenous iron\n\n\nand Request an appointment with the gastroenterologist\n\n\nbecause surely if you’re this anaemic your stomach must be bleeding.\n\n\nAlright then, I guess.\n\n\n\n\nAs he discharges me, the doctor jokes\n\n\nabout how nice the rooms are up on the 15th floor,\n\n\nas if hospitalization is the right thing to chuckle warmly about.\n\n\nI think he’s well-intentioned and has a good grasp of haematological\n\n\nmedicine but I was glad to leave, go home,\n\n\nand spend a month in bed resting\n\n\nwhile the weather turned warm.\n\n\nOut the 14th floor waiting-room window I see the sky, the city, beyond.\n\n\nNearby another patient sits down and opens a book:\n\n\nThe Most Beautiful Quebecois Poems.\n\n\nI glance back outside\n\n\na small brown-speckled spider weaves its web\n\n\nacross the glass. From where I’m standing\n\n\nit’s bigger than the construction workers,\n\n\nbigger than the pedestrians, almost the size of the police cruiser\n\n\ntwo intersections away. Waiting there,\n\n\nrefusing to sit in the disinfected chairs,\n\n\nI wonder what good all the poetry in the world\n\n\nwill do this single arachnid\n\n\nspinning its home over Mooniyang.\n\n\n\n\nThe centre de prélèvements is a resolutely hygienic space.\n\n\nBlood draws occur 7am-3pm M-F.\n\n\nWait times are short for patients who get blood taken here up high.\n\n\nI ask a nurse how many blood tests a day she’s doing lately.\n\n\nIt depends, but a little over 100.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re checking my auto-immune system,\n\n\nit’s been known to eat away at me.\n\n\nPlatelets, also called thrombocytes,\n\n\nare tiny cells that are essential for normal blood clotting.\n\n\nWhen platelets are particularly low,\n\n\ninternal bleeding is a risk,\n\n\nand I get acutely aware of my skin’s surfaces\n\n\nits folds, distracted by specks of the outer world\n\n\nthat brush up against it, egg-albumin thin.\n\n\nThe circulatory system is a series of veinous corridors,\n\n\nhighways, canals, transit arteries carrying blood along.\n\n\nThe lightest pressure might bruise and the lightest scrape might tear.\n\n\nSo we test.\n\n\nSharp metal insertion somewhere along the arm. Middling.\n\n\nPrimary symptoms are: excessive bruising, bruising in excess of what one\nwould’ve expected for the amount of trauma, or bruises that are totally\nunexplained.\n\n\nWhen my daily life is asymptomatic, the blood work makes sure to rectify\nthe notion that everything is normal. Platelet counts outside the norm\nhave been my everyday for 19 years. I wonder whether we’ll get to stop\ncounting anytime soon?\n\n\nInternal bleeding’s a slow dissolving of veinous layers melding into a\ncontiguous ocean of blood. Carefully mapped out roads falling into\ndisarray as in-betweens flood. Microscopic terror as a shortage of\nplatelets leads to tidal waves overcoming the sea walls under\nmaintained, decimated by an overzealous team of white blood cells.\n\n\nIf this shows up to the naked eye at all, it’s usually as ‘petechiae’;\ntiny red pinpoints in the skin, little red-blue dots along the arms, the\nlegs, around the groin. Mini-bruises.\n\n\nEven invisible illness is subject to sight. Can we stop counting anytime\nsoon? Put blood under a microscope and find out just how its balance\nturns out. Break it down into categories for testing, count out with\nfrightening exactitude just how much of this that and whatever else my\nbody happened to contain at 7:32am on August 25th, 2020.\n\n\nMy haematologist’s job is precisely to make sense of the clinical\nminutiae contained within blood. Logic takes a crack at making sense of\nour lifeblood, and I can’t help but laugh.\n\n\nIt’s time I got out of here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSainte-Anne-des-Monts\n\n\n2020-11-11\n\n\n\n\nOù patientons-nous? \nl’aéroport\nen file d’attente\npour le courrier\npour que l’eau se mette à bouillonner\nlorsque le four se réchauffe\net à l’hôpital\n\n\n\nLe lit d’hôpital: lieu du patient; espace rituel; espace professionnel;\nintime; transportatif; hétérotopique; contemplatif; l’espace de la vie\nde la fin.\n\n\nDu lit, les patient.es observent l’action logistique d’un support vital\nhumain et machinique.

Ce n’est pas à ce corps de se mêler de ces affaires. Assise\ncouchée deux oreillers ou bien trois, les couvertures bien blanches\nquestion d’apercevoir la saleté. Autour du lit il y a des rideaux, des\ngadgets. Au moins une machine qui fait Beep, Beep, mais probablement\nplus d’une. Acier inoxydable le lit avec ses barrières amovibles et ses\nroues qui permettent l’examination sous tout plein d’angles.\n\n\nL’aiguille me réveilla tous les jours.

Nul\ndoute plus simple d’accepter ce qui se dit ici et là sans trop douter.\nPeut-être qu’on se rassoit, bien confortable, sur le divan, visionnant\nla télé, l’écoute plus ou moins attentive.

Taking\nstock of bodily anxieties to integrate and loosen the tensions that have\nstacked subconsciously over years of life. Sitting meditation is not\nenough on its own to dislodge the stone of sense-memory in your chest.\nStone which holds a past as yet unknown to our waking mind. Sitting may\nreveal some of your story, doubtful whether a clear flow will be made to\npass only by bringing attention to the spot. Maybe with many months and\nyears. Meditation must not be undertaken with an end goal. Circling some\nimaginary end turns the practice into a chore rather than a steady\ndevotion. Not unlike caring for and maintaining friendships.\n\n\nYou are my dearest friend and my most intimate lover.\n\n\nYou carry us throughout it all, the joy of dance\n\n\nthe pain of needles\n\n\nand still you embrace life anew each breath.\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI used to strive for a return to a mythical healthy Before,\n\n\nbut in fact moving forward in resolving my bodily enigma means\n\n\nintegrating the old into a process of aging\n\n\ninto a body that’s never existed before.\n\n\n\n\nYears ago you were deemed by some men\n\n\nin labcoats to be somehow wrong.\n\n\nHow long we believed them and their numbers.\n\n\nTo them you are subject to categorical classification like\n\n\nboy/sick/anemic/thrombocytopenic.\n\n\nHa!\n\n\nI remember lying in bed desperately running my hands over your neck your\nneck your skull seeking a pulse anywhere. So long as fingers found the\nthump thump it meant you were still alive. When I couldn’t find any I’d\ngo sleep with Maman because her life force would save you, surely.\n\n\nThe heartbeat found in so many crooks and crannies where your veins\nsurface was the only assurance I had that you were still there anchoring\nme, keeping me grounded rather than floating lost in the cosmos behind\nyour eyelids.\n\n\nYour fingertips were the access point for sensation, the means I had for\nconnecting through touch long before we learned the words proprio- or\nintero-ception. Developing a vocabulary for your capacities has the\nstunning effect of producing new possibilities for existing.\n\n\n\n\nI feel perfectly at home within you.\n\n\nThis was not always the case.\n\n\nFor years sensation was a necessary evil\n\n\nI tried by every means to minimize.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolade imposes stress on the body.\n\n\nTension build-up as chemical release creates reactions.\n\n\nI feel tightness that begins in my eyes and needles red to the base of\nmy skull.\n\n\nI am taking 75mg a day as of writing this line (Oct 26 2020).\n\n\nThat’s 50+25mg each morning, after breakfast.\n\n\nC’est dans la moelle, osseuse tant qu’épinière, que je ressens la chimie\nmédicale.\n\n\nRevolade is: Eltrombopag olamine thrombopoetin receptor agonist\n\n\n\n\nMeds oct 26 around 7am.\n\n\nRush of anxiety at 1pm.\n\n\nEarlier today my stoole was of solid soft texture and medium brown,\n\n\nheld together well in 3 small logs.\n\n\nWater had a red tint.\n\n\nBeets last eaten 2 days ago, I think?\n\n\nMeals yesterday: oats, pizza, bean chili.\n\n\nCan black beans change stool color?\n\n\nCooked from dry myself.\n\n\nNo stomach aches but anxiety held onto that red tinge—\n\n\nfear of blood.\n\n\n(it was because of pickled beets)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeds\n\n\noct 27-28-29 : 50mg @ 8am.\n\n\n30th, 50mg 9am\n\n\n31st 50mg 830am\n\n\nNov 1 same\n\n\nnov 2 same\n\n\nnov 3 11am\n\n\n\n\nDeath is a sculptor.

Few things are appetizing.\n\n\nI’m craving more meat, far less sugar.\n\n\n\n\nI gave up one upside (reliable platelet counts)\n\n\nwith many potential downsides.\n\n\nIn exchange for a downside\n\n\n(the return of thrombocytopenia),\n\n\nwith many potential upsides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 18 2020: Petichia appear on hands+wrists,\n\n\nespecially left side, around 5pm.\n\n\nLooking down at my hand and discovering it covered with bruises\n\n\nbrought a rush of anxiety bubbling up my spine\n\n\ninto an explosion of brain fog.\n\n\nNoise, monochromatic, crowding all sensation.\n\n\nLight-headed I lay down and discover my body is not in any pain.\n\n\nFear is mental, with physical effects.\n\n\nSymptoms nearly gone by 7pm.\n\n\n\n\nMorning Dec 19th: symptoms gone.\n\n\n\n\nThe process of healing is anything but linear.\n\n\nNo teleology of worse to better to best.\n\n\nOnly sickness, in waves.\n\n\nSitting with that.\n\n\nFeeling its variety.\n\n\nAutoimmunity is perhaps a harsh teacher.\n\n\nIts lessons are written in blood upon the moist parchment.\n\n\n\n\nAutoimmunity is perpetual.\n\n\nThe body is the nexus through which time is enacted in space.\n\n\nCyclical returns defy linear narratives of healing\n\n\npremised on empire’s prescriptive timeline\n\n\nof how a human life may be lived.\n\n\nSome see the body as static, preformed,\n\n\npre-determined biotechno-processes.\n\n\nAutoimmunity defies such simplistic reductionism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this an exit?\n\n\nI did not tell the medical staff I ceased my treatment.\n\n\nI look up from my phone\n\n\nwith the urge to plunge into a search for escape.\n\nDuckduckgo: “Monasteries in Canada”\n\nBut it is not so simple to heal.\n\n\nI am where I am, here, and I know I am staying put.\n\n\nThe weight of place and the weight of self.\n\n\nCommitment to new patterns exposes the rhythmic\n\ntides of solitary doubt.\n\nWhat am I so angry about? Why am I so confused?\n\n\nThe isolation is crushing, mulching.\n\n\nI feel like I’m composting my whole lived experience\n\nand it is infuriatingly slow.\n\nI feel like nothing is leading anywhere.\n\nLIMBO drags ever onward and back.\n\n\n\nThe body sweats out the chemistry and I\n\n\nstop costing the province 4500$/month.\n\n\nThe molecular coercion keeping my stem\n\n\ncells constantly productive fades away,\n\n\nand the truth of a body in mourning is allowed to reappear.\n\n\nMy grief is visible in the bruise\n\n\nthat takes two weeks to heal.\n\n\nIt is visible in the petechiae\n\n\nthat constellate my arms, thighs, feet.\n\n\nNotice grief when I shit\n\n\nand the t.p comes away splotched with fresh blood.\n\n\nHow do I live in a way that is not self-destructive,\n\n\nnot harmful to life, and reconcile that with grieving?\n\n\nWhy am I bleeding? What did I do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunion\n\n\n2021-01-207\n\n\n\n\nHow do I communicate with the invisible aspects of my\nbody,\n\nwith that which is occulted?\n\n\n\n\nThe occulted body is literally that which is the body unseen.\n\n\nKinaesthetic awareness. Motorsensory education. Somatic experience.\n\n\nBlood and tissue and all we ingest. Digestion is occult.\n\n\n\n\nInner alchemy, breath, the shifting locus of intentional focus.\n\n\nSensing blood and tissue and bone, the watery and the earthen self.\n\n\nThere’s no quantitative analysis available\n\n\nfor making rational sense of this relationship,\n\n\nthere is only a quality of divine apprehension\n\n\nthat may be glimpsed when I am allowed to return to the source.\n\n\nVoid of preconceived notions limiting what may be possible,\n\n\nI encounter a depth charge that shatters expectations.\n\n\nTaking the heart for a drum beat, beat, beat\n\never onward inward seeking not after answers\nbut for ever more precise questions.\n\nFor it is in the asking that insight is revealed.\n\n\n\n\nI pause, and wonder whether this journey is plausible.\n\n\nBalk at myself momentarily: “Ha! You’re in no position to understand.”\n\nYet shed these doubts, for if not I then whom?\n\nSurely no external measure no number holds the key to my flesh.\n\n\nIt is not written in law that I may not know myself.\n\n\nAny such contract is none that I have agreed to, and as such is one I\nreject.\n\nNo intermediary may intervene on my behalf,\nno priest/ess teach me what is true.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe needle interjects:\n\n\nI shall enumerate the reality of your blood.\n\n\nOnly if I should let it.\n\n\nAgain today I sat in a blue chair to bleed red\n\n\nfeed the sterile machinery. To what end?\n\n\n\n\nMonths without testing have left me alive,\n\n\nawake to internal life.\n\n\nA nurse asks: “Who told you to do that?”\n\n\nNo one, it was an autonomous decision.\n\n\nWe’ll see what the doctor has to say about the numbers\n\n\nabstracting my lifeblood, when we next speak on the phone.\n\n\n\n\nI know myself by practicing, by attempting,\n\n\nby sharing, by delving, by attending, by devotion.\n\n\nI seek the questions to illumine the body’s\n\n\niterative becoming, it’s multiplicity of discontinuities.\n\n\nNever shall I presume to have reached a conclusion.\n\n\nNever shall the flesh have revealed itself fully.\n\n\nTo make such presumptions is folly\n\n\nfrom there the inevitable decline.\n\n\nSo long as I maintain my ignorance,\n\n\nI have much to learn, so much to learn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week really kicked my ass. On a daily basis I whirl between depths\nand heights of confusion and certainty. I miss doing drugs. 2017-2019\nare marked by intermittent cannabis, psilocybin, LSD and DMT use.\nSeeking spiritual-scientific hyperthick multidimensionality. “Am I doing\nwhat I ought to be doing?” always on my mind. The short of it is that\nthere is no “should” or “ought.”\n\n\nPicked up Brothers Karamazov today; Ivan’s Grand Inquisitor, with his\npolemic against the Almighty, and man’s inability to handle freedom.\n\n\nAm I unable to handle freedom? What does freedom mean to me?\n\nWould I rather have my life dictated to me?\n\nI have been choosing to eat according to auto-immunity for a week,\n\nwith minor slip-ups.\n\nIt’s going okay. I called Maman last night to complain that it feels\nlike nothing I do is effectual. She reminds me:\n\nYou are undergoing huge transitions.\n\nAnd so I am.\n\n\nHere’s where I’m at:\n\n\nI live alone\n\n\nI don’t smoke\n\n\nI don’t drink\n\n\nI don’t watch TV\n\n\nI don’t watch Movies\n\n\nI don’t Follow The News\n\n\nI don’t drink coffee\n\n\nI don’t eat grains\n\n\nI don’t eat legumes\n\n\nI don’t eat sugar.\n\n\nI sit in contemplation\n\n\nI read books\n\n\nI cook for myself\n\n\nI go on walks\n\n\nI talk to friends\n\n\nI visit my grandmother\n\n\nI sleep\n\n\nI listen to selected podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy dreams lately have been about learning, workshopping, being taught by\nmany teachers. I hear that when the student is ready, the teachers\nappear. I believe my mystery school is in my unconscious. There, and\nalso on the internet, in the texts. I want to live a mystical life, a\nmagical life, a mysterious life, an enchanted life, a godly life, a\ndaoist life, a natural life, a simple life, a good life.\n\n\nAnd I wonder, what does that mean?\n\n\nLove and Joy and Sex and Compassion and Strategy and Ritual and Passages\nand Thinking and Speaking and Birthing and Decaying and Growing and\nSowing and Reaping and Listening and Singing and Shouting and Seeing and\nFreezing and Heating. No deficiency and no excess. Always cycling back.\n\n\nImperfection reigns here. Amidst confusion, I breathe in out deep as\never possible but I feel bloated, weighed down by the unknowns. Why is\nmy body this way? How did it come to be? What can I do? Do the\nnot-doing, says the Dao. Therein lies a key, for certain. Wu Wei helps\nme glean new insight, new possibilities. Ever a quest for such avenues\nas yet unexplored.\n\n\nThis way or that? A new path or old? Am I here for myself or for\nanother? Are we together or apart? I’ve never ceased exploring, all I\ncan say is that rational sense is overrated. I don’t want your logic,\nyour boxes. But I’m trying to understand how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegressing Moves Forward\n\n\n2021-02-01\n\n\n\n\n9am, I take 25mg Revolade.\n\nFirst dose since November.\n\n\nYesterday a bruise appeared spontaneously on my right hand ring finger\nwhile I walked to Mamie’s. I am accepting the efficacy of medicine, I\nsuppose. I am not going to let my body self-destruct while I scramble\nfor alternatives. No, I will instead find safe, stable ground from which\nto carry on. This decision feels like failure, like admitting defeat.\n\n\nAuto-immunity tells me the world is toxic, the body rebels, and I must\nrespond in the ways that best assure my quality of life. I am saddened\nthat I must remain in this particular entanglement, with this particular\nmolecule. Why? Why does this remedy bother me? Is it purely the cost? Am\nI so opposed to medicine or to profit? Have I not been treated well? Why\nfight?\n\n\nI want to collaborate with the chemistry activating my bone marrow.\nThank you, Pharmacy, for making it possible that a small daily pill lead\nto the generation of more numerous blood platelets. Indeed, such\nprecision is miraculous and ought not be shunned outright. This return\nto treatment is not failure, it is a testament to the non-linearity of\nhealing. I now have a simple confirmation and perhaps that is what I\nsought.\n\n\nI am still auto-immune. The beauty and chaos of winging it is that\nultimately there are no wrong answers. The autonomy of embodied life\nlies in choosing how to interpret one’s relation to the world.\n\n\n\n\nThe summer before first grade there was a heatwave in QC City. Maman was\nlooking for a job, for a place to live, for a school. I was going to\nday-camp. I’d been sick/blind nearly a year. We left Vancouver to be\ncloser to family, to save money. First week of camp I got up the courage\nto stay overnight with the other kids. First day of first grade I didn’t\ngo to school because Maman couldn’t bring me. Instead my sitter, some\ncollege student, asked me what I wanted to do that day. Movies or\nmuseums? Easy choice, museums. The oldest colonial city on Turtle Island\nhas excellently stocked imperial showrooms, no doubt.\n\n\nIt is not that the sick child is not talked about, or even invisible.\n\n\nWe have our own hospitals, TV spots, fundraisers.\n\n\nRather the sick child is monstrous, abhorrent, pitiable.\n\n\nThe sick child is voiceless. A body to whom things happen;\n\n\nunfortunate, sad, oh-im-so-sorry things.\n\n\nThe sick child in Canada is an icon.\n\n\nAlways the first victim, the most vulnerable.\n\n\nThe most susceptible to environmental racism and differential\ngovernance.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I got diagnosed, my single mother quit her job\n\n\nrelied on the goodwill of friends.\n\nWe didn’t have health insurance anyway.\nWhy would we? Canada’s got it covered, right?\n\nBut so-called “universal healthcare” only applies to certain treatments.\n\nMy mother went into debt to keep her sick child treated.\n\nIn The Argonauts, Maggie Nelson’s third-party account of their child\nsays Iggy “couldn’t care less” at having his body handled by medicine.\nThis is an example of an adulthood shrug, Maggie’s ignoring the\nsignification of testing upon a body that will bear the (in)visible\nmarks of illness for its entire life, as many of us do. But Trauma does\nnot preclude joy. Is medical intrusion necessarily, inherently\ntraumatic?\n\n\nThe (chronically, terminally, irreparably) sick child is a poster,\n\na footnote, a statistic by which institutions\nseek funding and conduct research.\n\nIggy is reified as a statistic in Nelson’s account\n\n\nbecause their mother could not resist the lure\n\n\nof the exceptional sick child who pulls through despite the odds.\n\n\n(just like me, dear reader, hurrah)\n\n\n\n\nThe sick child is the object of fascination\n\n\nin countless books, studies, memoirs of parenthood,\n\n\nsermons and prayers, and many, many oil paintings.\n\n\nThe narrative is almost always the same:\n\n\nYears of mis-diagnosis, disbelief by doctors,\n\n\nsuffering, as life is turned topsy-turvy\n\n\n(How could this happen to us?)\n\n\neventual acceptance\n\n\nand barely veiled moralizing\n\n\nabout the myth of recovery\n\n\n(aren’t we all sick anyway?)\n\n\nThe parent of the sick child is afraid, so afraid. What worse fate than\nto hold your child’s hand as they whither away, body seemingly turned\nagainst itself, unable to walk, a fading living limbo.\n\n\nMemoirs of sickness (this one included)\n\n\nare fetishistic at best, romantic doldrums at worst.\n\n\nIs anyone really interested in our hundreds of E.R visits?\n\n\nWhy? The emergency room is a circle of hell.\n\n\nIt is boring, tiresome, and smells awful.\n\n\nLike barely preserved decomposition.\n\n\nA healthy reader picks up an illness memoir to glimpse life in That\nOther Place, crosses themselves and kisses their healthy child’s\nforehead: “Please God, may such a thing never befall our family.” But of\ncourse, sickness isn’t so easily warded off.\n\n\nIt is not the intention of this text to say: Ignore doctors! Any reading\nwhich takes that to be the point is shallow at best. Once, clearly, for\nthe record: Medical practice is at times essential and life-saving.\n\n\nNor is this tract a call to internet-search quackery. What is essential\nis bodily self-knowledge, and an end to total reliance upon the tools of\nexperts with an MD. I am writing to give shape to the fury, and thus\ncease being merely patient, merely sick.\n\n\n\n\nWe never complained of poor treatment.\n\n\nI wrack my memory now for instances\n\n\nof incompetence or negligence.\n\n\nAll I can say for my case is that sometimes\n\n\na nurse would fail to do their duty with a needle,\n\n\nand many pinpricks were made where one should have sufficed.\n\n\nBut what is one needling among hundreds?\n\n\nThere are banal instances of bother\n\n\ncommon to inpatient life\n\n\n(getting to the washroom with an IV pump? Annoying.)\n\n\nbut over time one gets habituated quite well.\n\n\nFor some years I felt that it is much preferable\n\n\nto be in a hospital if one is sick.\n\n\nWhere better?\n\n\nMy logic was that the odds of survival\n\n\nmust be greater in such a place.\n\n\nNow I’m not always so sure.\n\n\n\n\nThe only real complaint I have is the food,\n\n\nand perhaps that’s why\n\n\nI don’t think of hospitalization\n\n\nas necessarily beneficial, now.\n\n\nHow is anyone supposed to get stronger eating white bread,\n\n\ncorn flakes, mashed potatoes, and juice from concentrate?\n\n\n\n\nBut I forget myself, and hear now clearly\n\n\nthe inevitable retort:\n\n\nFree healthcare though!\n\n\nYes indeed,\n\n\nbut how much does the endless IV drip really cost?\n\n\nIt’s a matter of method, of priorities, of budgeting.\n\n\nWhat contracts underlie the treatment practices\n\n\nin public institutions?\n\n\nWhat long-term commitments to pharmacy?\n\n\n\n\nAuto-immune is itself a word\n\n\nthat would do violence to the wholeness of being,\n\n\nA rejection of self by self, a biological self-loathing.\n\n\nRepent! For thy cells do you wrong. I reject this morality.\n\n\nAuto-immunity is not an individual state of being.\n\n\n\n\nBut what better turn of phrase?\n\n\nI’ve given up on explanation,\n\n\nand will content myself with stating:\n\n\nIf I am to heal, it is because I am kind\n\n\nto the cells that compose me.\n\n\n\n\nHow much youth uselessly buried?\n\n\nMaybe home will be discovered in writing about you.\n\n\nRaised and medicated near and far from our birthplace,\n\n\nyet always rootless, treading chlorinated water.\n\n\nTaking it slow has revealed a hollowness where a spleen used to rest\n\n\nand in the nodes of a liver recuperating.\n\n\nWhat we’re doing here is writing up blueprints, cryptic as any other.\n\n\n\n\nKnowing my body is sacred activism.\n\n\nIt once seemed abhorrent in every way.\n\n\nMonstrous, without divinity.\n\n\nYears of setting you down on the page,\n\n\npages of organs, of shattered conceptions,\n\n\nof disavowal, of leaning into gravity.\n\n\nWould that these pages held\n\n\nreams of philosophical nuance\n\n\nwhere instead only fragments of experience are laid bare.\n\n\n\n\nHow sick and pitiable some reader may find us.\n\n\nYou, a bloody mess. Me, frantically attempting to make sense of it all.\n\n\nThe modes of address are idiosyncratic at best,\n\n\ndisjointed on average, incomprehensible at worst.\n\n\nSo what? These pages are yours and mine,\n\n\nshared with the world but never bowing to its demands for propriety.\n\n\n\n\nI’m after is a sort of sanguine seeing.\n\n\nA blood sight\n\n\nthrough which genealogy may be known and harnessed.\n\n\nWhat I came to realize is that Revolade occluded the possibility\n\n\nof knowing the blood that flows through me as my own.\n\n\nBlood remains ever co-mingled with, well, everything.\n\n\n(How do the Californian grapes that I am eating change my physiology?)\n\n\nIt is a matter of gaining more minute control over what we absorb.\n\n\nVoluntary detoxicity where possible.\n\n\n\n\nFoods have subtler impacts than pharmacy but also offer fewer risks.\n\n\nLeave fewer traces and are (perhaps) less resource intensive to create.\n\n\nWhy exactly is a 28-day course of 75mg Revolade 4500CAD?\n\n\nSurely the ingredients aren’t so cost intensive?\n\n\nHow are global supply chains mobilized\n\n\nto create thrombopoetin receptor agonists?\n\n\nPutting these questions down in writing hurts,\n\n\nin the way confronting any unpleasant unknown may hurt.\n\n\nPrior to finding factual answers, I can only speculate that what I find\n\n\n(if indeed such information is traceable)\n\n\nwill reinforce a hatred of vertically integrated exploitation\n\n\nwith new details telling me what I basically already know.\n\n\nSo why hunt? Why seek out the nitty-gritty? Must we?\n\n\n\n\nSadness and hunger are often confusedly intermingled feelings.\n\n\nDeep in the gut, clenching tension.\n\n\nI’ll regularly eat when I’m already sated just to quench the feeling.\n\n\nI’ve only recently realized this. It’s difficult to admit to myself that\nI am sad.\n\n\nThat the muscular holding impulse is a defence mechanism\n\n\nI developed to shield me from my feelings.\n\n\nA tight muscle hides sensation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy gut acts as a barrier between the upper and lower places of the body.\n\n\nRight around my centre of gravity at the navel is where tension hides.\n\n\nHonest feeling reveals that the impulse to eat right after lunch\n\n\nstems from a fear of digestion.\n\n\nBoth food and emotion require parasympathetic integration.\n\n\nIt’s not yet clear, the source of this specific habit.\n\n\nThere are any number of reasons to avoid integrating/digesting\nnegativity.\n\n\nWhat I know now is that without making space inwardly for the sorrow to\nebb and flow, it will inevitably overrun the territory, as rivers caught\nbehind a dam. Flooding damages so many disparate and interconnected\naspects of self/world ecology. Superficial methods for instant\ngratification (A snack!) bloat the canals of feeling where/when sadness\nmay be felt deeply, as not merely pain, but as an essential marker of\nenfleshed reality. As above, so below. If I do not allow the body to\nbecome hungry, I will not discover what it desires and, by the same\ntoken, what it needs.\n\n\nThe thrombopoetin receptor agonist I took for 5 years had the medically\npalliative effect of (mostly) maintaining my body’s platelet counts\naround the normal range. The drug also comes with a long list of\nside-effects, chief among which is anaemia. Funny, the doctors were\nunable to find the source of the anemia detected through blood work, so\nI took huge iron supplements for three years.\n\n\nNone of us thought to consider ceasing the main pill. Instead, more\ntests, more pills, more needles. Absurd.\n\n\nA phone call from the gastroenterologist:\n\n\nHer voice rings hollow with cavernous surprise\n\n\nupon learning my body’s iron eventually corrected itself\n\n\nwithout their pills or needles.\n\n\nShy, I suggest the medicine may have been a culprit.\n\n\nShe disagrees, but is pleased\n\n\nthat her needless test\n\n\ncan still make it into the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am living through a whirlwind right now.\n\n\nI feel physically renewed,\n\n\neach day more attuned to needs.\n\n\nPhysically awakening to overwhelming optionality.\n\n\nEach day assailed with endless What Ifs.\n\n\nSome acts are underway.\n\n\nSome future worry seeps into the daily where it needs not.\n\n\nMy dreams are teachers.\n\n\nThe world’s inexorable advance continues shifting.\n\n\nA day contains so much yet so little.\n\n\nA night so short yet so expansive.\n\n\nWho said anything about winning and losing?\n\n\nWhat about letting go of focus? Practice.\n\n\nSometimes I am anxious to get going.\n\n\nOther times staying put is bliss.\n\n\nCertain decision are within my control,\n\n\nand many uncertainties exist without.\n\n\nDo I seek simple passive comfort? No.\n\n\nAm I after integrated wellbeing? Surely.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the well meaning friend\n\n\nto the polemical witch,\n\n\neveryone agrees:\n\n\nOne must first heal oneself.\n\n\n\n\nNo need to create harsh laws of self-rule.\n\n\nSuch discipline is not only joyless, it is harmful.\n\n\nDo what is of interest, and nurture ongoing discovery.\n\n\nCertainly, some things are better avoided,\n\n\nbecause we have learned through trial and error\n\n\nthat bone and blood respond poorly to exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis extends into the mediatic.\n\n\nDon’t ingest harmful thoughts needlessly,\n\n\nand allow time for digesting the emotions that arise from encounters.\n\n\nWe are not in a hurry.\n\n\nCalls to productivity are best ignored outright. A diagnosis of\nautoimmunity blames the individual bodyfor shortcomings in the world.\nMedicine refuses to acknowledge that 24/7 lives of submission to capital\nare inherently sick demand, and thus turns suffering inward, as though\nevery doctor were Nietzsche diagnosing the Christians. When medicine\nspeaks of auto-immunity it does not mean a body evoking demands to\nattention. No, the body becomes the enemy.\n\n\nWell, I refuse.\n\n\nMy body is not my enemy.\n\n\nIt is my lover and teacher and my best friend.\n\n\nIt is the vessel of cosmic life through which I am\n\nenfleshed, however briefly,\n\nand I will not submit its corporeality to management.\n\n\n\n\nIf one’s inner experience won’t convince others,\n\n\nthen it is best to cease seeking after external validation,\n\n\nand trust instead inward.\n\n\nDon’t seek for what is already within you.\n\n\nRather, accept its presence and behave accordingly.\n\n\nEvaluating the situation is of course an ongoing effort.\n\n\nBut why collapse time even further by worrying about a future that is\nmalleable?\n\n\nFor now, live now. Much is revealed with careful listening to stillness.\n\n\nI repeat: there is no rush. Rest.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does fixing do?\n\n\nIt implies brokenness,\n\n\nas if a given version of self could not harness\n\n\nthe beauty of wellbeing without external influence.\n\n\n\n\nAs vultures, we seek for that which serves us in the ruins.\n\n\nThe thing of beauty is discovery of inner experience’s malleability.\n\n\nAs much as the world makes me, I make the world.\n\n\nWhy doubt what has yet to be attempted?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnxiety is a bigger threat to my wellbeing than thrombocytopenia.\n\n\nIs healing a matter of patience?\n\n\nIs it about letting myself have bad days?\n\n\nIs it, rather, knowing that a day is never bad in itself,\n\n\nand I need only be gentle with my expectations?\n\n\nHow can I possibly heal without medicine?\n\n\nHow can we have let that word, medicine,\n\n\ntake on so narrow an understanding?\n\n\nWhat happens when the pharmacy does far more harm than is its due?\n\n\nAre there ways to heal that come with no pain, no suffering?\n\n\nIs there such a thing as medicine without side-effects?\n\n\n\n\nIt’s as if birth itself is the fall, towards death, the horror.\n\n\nRather my body is always in the process of composing itself.\n\n\nAs the cosmos is alive and populated by mystery,\n\n\nI live into the creation myth while my body cycles back around\n\n\nsickness, healing, growth, decay.\n\n\n\n\nThe documents in my archive of care create a linear fiction of\ntreatment.\n\n\nA correspondence of actors playing out their role in the narrative:\n\n\n\n\nThe fall, in which sickness occurs.\n\nDiagnosis, treatment, so much drama.\n\nAnd the resolution around which the narrative is formed:\n\nrecovery.\n\nAfter which I ought to thank my tireless experts,\n\n\nbecause a teen spokesperson for the appropriate\n\nRare Illness Support Association,\n\nand run a marathon fundraiser in order to prove\n\nthat I overcame,\n\ngot my Normal Body back, and with enough determination,\n\nyou too can Recover.\n\nOf course some, perhaps many, sick people, want to not be sick any more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this seems like a misunderstanding.\n\n\nWe do not desire a return to normal,\n\n\nWe only want joyous embodiment.\n\n\nNever in their lives would the doctors venture\n\n\nautoimmunity as a positive experience.\n\n\nAlways, it is merely another reason to manage the occulted body.\n\n\nChemical technologies of control to regulate\n\n\nan autoimmune system which\n\n\nin my apprehension of life\n\n\nexceeds the merely material.\n\n\n\n\nCure is a myth, where returning to “before” collapses\n\n\nthe imperative linear time and reveals inner cyclicality.\n\n\nAuto-immunity shatters the telos upon shores of blood.\n\n\nIt is time itself, not our bodies, that is sick.\n\n\nIt is the clock as master and metaphor,\n\n\nthat British imperial naval technology,\n\n\nwhich wreaks havoc upon our flesh.\n\n\nIt is not cure you want. It is rest.\n\n\nWhat your body desires is an exit from alarm clocks,\n\n\nand a rhythm of its own. Our cells breathe at their own pace.\n\n\nIt’s a withdrawal from the incessant poison of empire that heals.\n\n\n\n\nI suppose I am in search of a cure. That’s the ‘reward’ around which\nI’ve been orienting my life, my striving. Unconsciously. Would it be\nbetter to seek cure consciously? Or to strive for acceptance and\nreconciliation with what is?\n\n\nI love this flesh; it is all I know. Sorry: that it must harm itself.\nGrieving for the blood shed inward. For why must a body be toxic? In\nthat question the endeavour: How is the human body made toxic?\n\n\nA record of treatment turns the ongoing chronicity of healing into a\npast cure, a fait accompli. The slew of blood tests fixes a fictionally\nstatic count of my body in time where a living organism is always\nshifting and responding to worldly cycles\n\n\nI have not spontaneously ceased this mode of self-defence. I have not\nentered a new realm of embodiment by changing locales and breathing new\nair. My existence is essentially continuous. I may not know where I’ll\nend up, or even where I’m going, but for the time being I sense that I’m\ndoing what I can to live a life of truth, harmony. Not pushing\nneedlessly in a direction that won’t have me, but feeling in the dark\nfor those secure handholds, where a latch awaits my touch. I do not mean\nthat the path must be easy—rather, that it must carry that distinct\nfeeling-tone of rightness.\n\n\nAll I really know is that I wake up each day, thankful for the gift that\nis life. I am assailed by doubt and uncertainties. What is there to\nensure that the world has meaning? I choose to believe the order has its\nown reason, which I may never grasp. The human answers do not satisfy\nme, even when those lives ordered by such stories appeal greatly.. The\nonly certainty is the is-ness of flesh. Through this is, the world is\nsensed in turn. Sensation is divine nature, the great teacher. Confusion\nis an aspect of the flesh, when the grandeur of sensing relations\noverwhelms the conscious. The flesh itself knows no limits, and may\nperceive the oneness of is-ness when left to sense without interference\nfrom my mind.\n\n\nThis is why it pains me to ingest pharmacology’s product. It stretches\nand expands the flesh according to logics I do not comprehend. It\nactivates my body as if it were separate from the mind—leaving me to\nmake sense of the flesh’s entangled nature all on my own. I am furious\nat the lack of guidance afforded me. None explain their reasoning:\nRecommendations come as blanket prescriptions, as band-aids. Is no one\nlooking causation, for cure? Am I?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading Phaedrus\n\n\n2021-02-26\n\n\n\n\nReading Plato because Simone Weil said he’s a mystic.\n\nBurnt through this quirky dialog.\n\n\nSocrates and Phèdre lounge beneath an old tree\n\n\nto ponder Love+Language.\n\n\nWhat is the role of madness in love?\n\n\nThey find that amorous impulse is driven by Aphrodite and Eros,\n\n\nand this divine compulsion is the greatest form of madness.\n\n\n\n\nThis, as counterpoint to the opening\n\n\nwith Lysias’ take against the man-in-love,\n\n\ncast as one who must not be trusted\n\n\nfor he can not act in mutual best-interest\n\n\nwhen under the influence of love.\n\n\nI’m pleasantly surprised by the ever-presence of gods\n\n\nas well as the relationship dynamics of greek men\n\n\nwho clearly understand that ecstasy is to be found in the flesh.\n\n\n\n\nIs followed by a less interesting section\n\n\non the foundation of rhetoric and dialectical method.\n\n\n\n\n1- Pick a subject\n\n\n2- break it down into composite parts\n\n\n3- Define those elements in such a way as to advance your argument.\n\n\n\n\nIs that what I’m doing here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVein To Vial\n\n\n\n\nThe topic here is a common medical intervention\n\nHuman blood plasma gets extracted,\n\nprocessed into a commodity,\n\nand administered through intravenous transfusion.\n\n\nPlasma becomes Privigen®,\n\n\nand is used to treat the writer’s thrombocytopenia,\n\n\nso-called platelet deficiency.\n\n\n\n\nPathology: a risk for spontaneous internal bleeding.\n\n\nOur plasma is part of my flesh, your flesh,\n\n\na liquid substrate of global haematology\n\n\nthe earth’s collective lifeblood, the global bloodstream.\n\n\n\n\nThinking blood across individual realities,\n\n\ndraw out blood’s complexity:\n\n\nenfold family, state violence, and environmental racism\n\ninto a gooey assemblage.\n\nScience’s narrow apprehension of materialist naturalism becomes\n\n\nan embodied entanglement of history and experience.\n\n\n\n\nMy blood is more than just my own,\n\n\nit is a collaboration, transits terrestrial arteries,\n\n\nits nature shifts as it is harvested and becomes\n\nraw biological resource.\n\nThe blood-products resulting from extraction are charged\n\n\nwith the intergenerational relationships and trauma\n\n\nhaving shaped the lives of people from whose bodies\n\nplasma is needled.\n\n\n\nPrivigen® is one blood product\n\namongst a class of drug known as IVIG.\n\nThis particular “Intravenous Immunoglobulin (Human) 10% Solution for\nInfusion”\n\n\nis manufactured by the self-styled\n\nGlobal Rare Disease Biotech Company, CSL Behring.\n\nThey harvest plasma in over 170 centres in the USA.\n\n\n\n\nConsider that blood-derived-medicine exists through the mutually\ncomposed actions of so many people, places, ancestors, sciences, arts,\nhistories, all acting within oneanother.

Given average\nannual income of around $1,200, the New York Times (February 11,\n1923) labeled donating blood the “1,001st Way to Make a Living;” the\ndonation price attracted people whose benefit from donating, from\naltruism and compensation, exceeded their costs (time, discomfort, and\nhealth risks)” (Slonim et al.)\n\n\nSo a donor today is paid\n\n\nroughly the same dollar amount for their plasma\n\n\nas they would have been for their blood 90 years ago.\n\n\nDonating plasma takes 2-3 hours per session.\n\n\nSo it transmutes to an hourly wage between 10-25$/hr.\n\nJust another gig.\n\n\n\nBlood plasma is extracted from whole blood during donation\n\n\nvia a process called plasmapheresis,\n\n\nwhich removes plasma and returns the remaining\n\n\nred blood cells and platelets to the donor.\n\n\nSince the 1960s,\n\nthis process has decreased the health risks for donors,\n\nmaking it possible to donate plasma as often as twice a week.\n\n\nWhole blood is collected on a volunteer basis\n\nnearly worldwide\n\nthanks to a variety of public initiatives.\n\n\nPlasma, on the other hand, is in short supply.\n\n\n\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century,\n\nnearly 70% of the world’s plasma\noriginated from the United States.\n\nIt is also the only nation in the world\n\nto be self-reliant in blood and plasma products\n\nthanks to a for-profit industry\n\n\nthat has evolved over a century.\n\n\nIn 2017, ABC Local News reported that\n\n\nthe payment [donors] receive averages about $30 to $40, and for\nthe companies, it is a $19.7 billion global industry.\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide, public funds funnelled into healthcare systems\n\n\nflow upwards to the multinational corporations\n\n\nmanufacturing the drugs used to treat the population:\n\n\n“Even with a largely voluntary supply of blood […] hospitals pay\nfor blood products and charge patients for their use.

implicit moral judgement about pornography\n\n\nand about the sexuality of patients.\n\n\nIt seems to me that the restriction of pornography\n\n\namounts to an important barrier of the potential\n\n\nfor a sexual identity among hospitalized patients.\n\n\nThe browsing restrictions built into the public WiFi\n\n\nserve as a moralizing proscription on the rights of adults\n\n\nto access legal materials online,\n\n\nas well as a prohibition of their identities as sexual beings.\n\n\n\n\nThe restrictions surrounding pornography in the hospital\n\n\nserve to further stigmatize groups of people already touted as asexual,\n\n\nand prevent patients from a common avenue\n\n\nfor sexuality, should they desire to engage.\n\n\n\n\nThe hospital’s mission is explicitly\n\n\nto promote health and well-being.\n\n\nThey aim to “facilitate healthy choices”,\n\n\n“lead meaningful interventions”,\n\n\nand facilitate “free and enlightened decision-making.”\n\n\n\n\nThat means condemning behaviours and habits\n\n\nthat may be detrimental to mental and physical wellness.\n\n\nThe public conversation’s effacement of sexual pleasure\n\n\nas a valuable part of daily life works hand-in-hand\n\n\nwith the dominant view that chronically ill people\n\n\ncould not possibly be concerned with sexuality\n\n\nto create a habitat that doesn’t think twice about denying\n\n\nits residents access to sexually explicit materials.\n\n\n\n\nBodies learn behaviours and habits when led by example.\n\n\nHere, bodily discipline is enforced by creating barriers to sexually\nexplicit material\n\n\nobviously linked with masturbation and sexual pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nThere are reams of papers showing that in clinical contexts,\n\n\npornography consumption is restricted to sanctioned medical uses\n\n\nsuch as research or “sexual rehabilitation” programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower over the acts permitted an individual is central\n\n\nto the formation of docile bodies;\n\n\ndisciplinary power creates a correlation\n\n\nbetween action and state of embodiment:\n\n\n“le contrôle disciplinaire ne consiste pas simplement à enseigner\n\n\nou à imposer une série de gestes définis;\n\n\nil impose la relation la meilleure\n\n\nentre un geste et l’attitude globale du corps” (p.178)\n\n\n\n\nDiscipline of embodied gestures is inextricably linked\n\n\nwith the betterment of a body’s behaviour.\n\n\nIn the case of health, if pornography is unhealthy,\n\n\nthen one must not be allowed to consume this poison\n\n\nwhen attempting to cast off other ills,\n\n\nor healing as a whole is jeopardized.\n\n\n\n\n“La punition est une technique de coercition des individus; elle met\nen oeuvre des procédés de dressage du corps avec les traces qu’il\nlaisse, sous formes d’habitudes, dans le comportement; et elle suppose\nla mise en place d’un pouvoir spécifique de gestion de la peine. Le\nsouverain et sa force, le corps social, l’appareil administratif. La\nmarque, le signe, la trace…”\nSurveiller et Punir, p.155\n\n\n\n\nThe patient’s experience is also one of attempting\n\n\nto forget one’s position,\n\n\nin order to allow time to pass more quickly.\n\n\nOne finds ways to distract oneself.\n\n\nIn my experience, every patient has their media of choice.\n\n\nReading, music, movies, games, social networks, work.\n\n\nAnything goes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular transfusion treatments and their side-effects\n\n\nmake it more difficult to reliably commit the time\n\n\nthat is demanded of the worker.\n\n\nHospitalization may force people to take\n\n\nsignificant amounts of time off work,\n\n\nif they are able to hold down a regular job.\n\n\n\n\nIVIG further impinges on a patient’s extra time,\n\n\ncompressing their opportunities for rest\n\n\ninto greater scarcity. The time carefully set aside\n\n\nfrom work becomes time to catch up\n\n\non the productive obligations\n\n\nthat medical commitments trespass upon.\n\n\nBeing a patient is unpaid work;\n\n\nwork that often requires paying to access;\n\n\nwork that actively takes away the resources\n\n\nacquired through productive labour.\n\n\n\n\nPatients are expected to work on their health.\n\n\nCrary’s book frames its discussion around sleep,\n\n\nwhich “in its profound uselessness and intrinsic passivity,\n\n\nwith the incalculable losses it causes in production time,\n\n\ncirculation, and consumption […] will always collide\n\n\nwith the demands of a 24/7 universe.”\n\n\nPrior to internet connectivity, hospitalized time\n\n\nfunctioned similarly to sleep vis-a-vis capitalism.\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of transfusions,\n\n\nit is required that the patient remain passively\n\n\nin place for the duration of the treatment\n\n\nand allow their body to do the slow work of chemical absorption.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, unlike sleep, the waking mind is still active during this time.\n\n\nThe patient is still a consumer, and with the arrival of WiFi\n\n\nin many hospitals and clinics it has become possible,\n\n\nperhaps necessary, for many chronically ill individuals\n\n\nto perform two occupations simultaneously: patient and worker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24/7 demands I forget about myself,\n\n\nfocus instead on the always-on world\n\n\nof production and consumption.\n\n\n\n\nThe parallel procedures of donation and transfusion\n\n\nare thus drawn together through internet access.\n\n\nWhile the donors and patients are alienated from their bodies\n\n\nby necessity, either for money or for cure,\n\n\nthey engage in the legible act of consumption.\n\n\n\n\nIf there’s no getting better, patients learn to work through it.\n\n\nFor people who are at the hospital regularly,\n\n\nit is not a vacation or an opportunity to focus on healing.\n\n\nIt is a part of the routine that must be accounted for\n\n\nin one’s crip-time management. One may ask oneself:\n\n\n“how much time do I need off work each month for this,\n\n\nfor the foreseeable future?”\n\n\n\n\nAlison Kafer meditates on ‘prognosis time’, calling it\n\n\n“a liminal temporality, a casting out of time; rather than a stable,\nsteady progression through the stages of life, time is arrested,\nstopped. Paradoxically, even as the very notion of ‘prognosis’ sets up\nthe future as known and knowable, futurity itself becomes tenuous,\nprecarious. But this very precariousness can […] become an impetus\nfor erotic investment in the present, in one’s diagnosed body.”\nFeminist, Queer, Crip, p. 36\n\n\nTo invest oneself in the present, in embodied experience,\n\n\nis a fundamental departure from capitalism.\n\n\nPaying attention to the material realities of treatment\n\n\nand the immediate situation, rather than ignoring them\n\n\nand hoping they pass, is a radical form of acceptance.\n\n\n\n\nIn the hospital chair of a WiFi-enabled institution\n\n\nthe networks of crip time and 24/7 careen into one another\n\n\nwithin one sick millennial’s laptop open to messenger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaiting\n\n\n2021-04-10\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been waiting for waiting to happen.\n\nAnd what do I do while I wait?\n\n\nGet dragged into computing habits staring at a screen\n\n\nwatching television eyes burning into my sockets.\n\n\nSmoking cannabis passing the time reminding myself\n\n\nthat waiting for the sake of waiting is not necessarily time lost.\n\n\nJournaling and omitting to transcribe,\n\n\nnot really sure what to do now\n\n\nthat certain projects are in another’s ballpark.\n\n\nHello, is anyone out there?\n\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n\nWhat do I think?\n\n\nI think I have to keep practicing\n\n\nand apply myself for the sake of myself,\n\n\nnot apply to work useless jobs.\n\n\nWould be nice for my days to feel substantial\n\n\nbut I can settle for early mornings\n\n\nout by the water moving what little qi I have.\n\n\nFrustrated some days that I have no one to share with,\n\n\nno teachers, no partners.\n\n\nOnly distant relations. No friends, really.\n\n\n\n\nSure, I know people, but what’s a friend?\n\n\nSomeone with whom to build life and share knowledge.\n\n\nThe people now in my life are on paths\n\n\nI find ultimately meaningless.\n\n\nIs that cruel?\n\n\nI suppose it’s best that I find my own life\n\n\na more interesting affair than any other,\n\n\nbut that does not lessen the burden\n\n\nof waking up and feeding myself, alone.\n\n\nThe weight of solitude turns me into a petty creature,\n\n\nstaving off boredom in what ways I can\n\n\nI slowly develop an ascesis\n\n\nthat will lead somewhere worthwhile.\n\n\nBut in pandemic it feels like nothing is worth doing, somedays.\n\n\nEven the most beautiful, the most powerful acts,\n\n\nthey fall short in my little solipsism.\n\n\nMagic, meditation, breathing, movement,\n\n\nthe forest,\n\n\nthe water.\n\n\nNone of it helps.\n\n\nCannabis helps, but only for an hour or two.\n\n\nThat’s not any good.\n\n\nMushrooms help, but imperceptibly.\n\n\nFrustrating, frustrating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVein To Vial, continued\n\n\n\n\nBut I digress, and \n\nmeanwhile, the needles do their own work.\n\n\n\n\nOnce the patient arrives for treatment,\n\n\na nurse measures body weight in order to determine\n\n\nthe speed and volume of the dose.\n\n\nThey prepare the intravenous catheter and ensure its proper functioning.\n\n\nThey program the pump, which is designed with the assumption\n\n\nthat its operators have a degree of medical knowledge\n\n\nto allow them to make sense of its many features and safely operate it.\n\n\nNurses keep track of the infusion rate,\n\n\nthe liquid’s volume, the patient’s vitals.\n\n\nThroughout the course of treatment, the pump and patient\n\n\nare regularly monitored by a nurse. At specific intervals,\n\n\na patient’s blood pressure and temperature are taken.\n\n\nThe process is not without risk, and common side-effects include\n\ndizziness, migraines, bodily pain, fever, and anxiety.\n\n\n\nDue to the commonness of side-effects\n\n\nduring IVIG treatment, it is crucial that the patient\n\n\nbe carefully monitored for their own safety.\n\n\nThe nurse’s role during the treatment is to\n\n\nuse their knowledge of medicine to actively track the data\n\n\ngenerated by the pump and the patient,\n\n\nas two machines to be monitored, checked on regularly—known to\nmalfunction.\n\n\n\n\nThe nurse’s view of the encounter is necessarily\n\n\ncolored by their medical training, years of practice\n\n\n(or lack thereof),\n\n\nand the relations of power that place\n\n\nthe nurse above the patient\n\n\nin the hierarchy of knowledge,\n\n\nbut always below the specialist doctor\n\n\nwhose signature mandates the prescription.\n\n\n\n\nMedical vernacular narrativizes illness as a fight,\n\n\nas a war to be waged against and within one’s own body.\n\n\nI’ll play along.\n\n\nExpectations during transfusion echo those of combat.\n\n\nWhile the patient is receiving IVIG,\n\n\ninvisible battles are waged at the cellular level,\n\n\ntheir body is receiving a drop shipment of reinforcements.\n\n\nGenerals keep informed by monitoring data.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the soldierly patient is caught in a skirmish\n\n\nwith the side-effects of their body’s shifting\n\n\nchemical (im)balance.\n\n\nVitals are assessed regularly by a nurse on duty,\n\n\nmonitoring the battleground.\n\n\nThe risks for the body are the driving factor\n\n\ndetermining the rhythm of the encounter with IVIG.\n\n\n\n\nBloodiness is a magnetism, an earthiness.\n\n\nObserving my own arms the veins are hills and tunnels.\n\n\nThey bulge and recess in turn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s commonplace for a nurse in a talkative mood\n\n\nto comment upon their quality.\n\n\nExpert appraisal has it: my veins are ripe for needling.\n\n\nNot that any of us are too eager.\n\n\nThey’re working, sticking needles into veins for days on end.\n\n\nSick work, bloody labour.\n\n\nMost nurses are highly skilled at this task.\n\n\nCommendable. It barely hurts.\n\n\n\n\nThe unpredictable nature of IVIG side-effects\n\n\ndemand an awareness of one’s own existence in the world,\n\n\ncoexisting with the machines,\n\n\nthe drugs, and the nurses all around\n\n\nand all implicated in the happening.\n\n\nAt a given moment during the transfusion,\n\n\nthe body might refuse the medication.\n\n\nIn spite of this, the patient is not expected\n\n\nto take an active part in the process.\n\n\nThe body only receives.\n\n\nMuch as plasma donors are invited to ‘relax with free wifi!’,\n\n\nthe patient is asked to sit back, breathe,\n\n\nand allow the requisite time to pass.\n\n\n\n\nBack into human corporeality through a new needle,\n\n\ndown the intravenous drip from the infusion pump\n\n\nand the sterile containers.\n\n\nThe crystalline substance comes into\n\n\nanother biological body at last.\n\n\nNot for the first time, not for the last time,\n\n\nI soak up it all up.\n\n\nFrame a photograph, click, freezing the drip…drip…drip…\n\n\nSitting cannulated, plenty of places I’d rather be,\n\n\nsat in a blue chair within blue walls\n\n\nbleeding red in purple veins\n\n\nwhile crystal clear plasma fractionations\n\n\nmake up the difference.\n\n\n\n\nThe human body and blood-product collide\n\n\nin their inescapable urge to merge,\n\n\nthe global bloodstream’s capillaries meeting in transfusion.\n\n\nFusion, underscoring the loss of discrete identities\n\n\nbetween the concoction and the body,\n\n\nimplies oneness and indissolubility.\n\n\n\n\nPrivigen® soon disappears and turns “Human” again\n\n\nwithin new veins. Co-mingling\n\n\nwith this new host, plasma-cum-Privigen®\n\n\nfinds a body different from the thousands it inhabited\n\n\nin its past lives. Plugged into the infusion pump,\n\n\nthe patient submits their human body\n\n\nto the clinical environment. The assimilation\n\n\nis accompanied by an array of multisensory reactions.\n\n\nThe experience of transfusion confers\n\n\na uniquely embodied knowledge,\n\n\nand the patient’s body must successfully\n\n\nassimilate, or reject the drug.\n\n\n\n\nA needle is a tool,\n\n\nmanufactured to transit blood into the realm of medicine:\n\n\nuse, examination, engineering, processing, alteration.\n\n\nIn opening a vein, the needle has served\n\n\nits utilitarian purpose.\n\n\nAs blood moves through the needle into a world of industry,\n\n\nthe needle comes into being through\n\n\na narrow technoscientific focus.\n\n\nA transitory, ephemeral vessel for blood,\n\n\ndesigned as a single-use object.\n\n\nA sterile puncturing device made of steel,\n\n\nwrapped in plastic,\n\n\nonly useful in conjunction with innumerable\n\n\noperative relations\n\n\nspecific to the bloodstream’s global assemblage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as blood has sufficiently flowed,\n\n\nwithdraw the needle and dispose of it.\n\n\nThrow it away into that specially marked\n\n\nfluorescent-yellow bin: biohazard.\n\n\nSo the needle’s journey continues into trash-heaps\n\n\nand landfills; tubes touched by human blood\n\n\nare too dangerous for recycling.\n\n\n\n\nNothing opens or closes this bloodstream\n\n\nthe flow is uninterrupted, only the map changes.\n\n\nPaths may shift but assemblages, in all their specificities,\n\n\nenact the relations which create words and flesh,\n\n\ndirt and water, none of which are discrete.\n\n\nBlood is the substance of human life,\n\n\nothered by its capture into the industry’s web.\n\n\n\n\nOn this map, the intravenous needle is the site of othering.\n\n\nIn Deleuze and Guattari’s terms,\n\n\nit is the machine which holds the key,\n\n\nthe cutting edge inserting itself into the donor\n\n\n(full of its all-too-fleshy organs, already organ-less,\n\n\nblood-less, mere raw material for sale),\n\n\ndrawing out essence from a single organism\n\n\nto a node within the planetary bloodstream.\n\n\n\n\nIn the acts of needling and blood-draw,\n\n\nblood is uprooted from its origin within the donor’s porous body\n\n\nand seeps into the territories of biotechnology\n\n\nand medical industry.\n\n\nIt becomes plasma.\n\n\n\n\nHydration and medication and nutrition share an entry point,\n\n\na singular superficial vein in the arm\n\n\nor the wrist or the hand.\n\n\n\n\nPrivigen®’s product monograph states that\n\n\n“the recommended initial infusion rate of Privigen® is\n\n\n0.5 mg/kg/min. If well tolerated, the rate of administration\n\n\nmay gradually be increased up to an infusion rate of 12 mg/kg/min.”\n\n\nLet’s pause for some quick math. I weigh approximately 60 kilograms.\n\n\n\n\n60kg x 2g = 120g or 120’000mg.\n\n\nMaximum rate of infusion: 12mg/kg/minute\n\n\n12mg x 60kg = 720mg per minute\n\n\nx 60 minutes = 43200mg per hour\n\n\n120’000mg total divided by 43’200mg/hour = 2.77 hours\n\n\nAt the maximum rate of infusion, the treatment takes just under 3 hours.\n\n\n\n\nNow the minimum: 0.5mg/kg/minute\n\n\n0.5mg x 60kg = 30 mg per minute\n\n\nx 60 minutes = 1800 mg per hour\n\n\n120’000mg total divided by 1800mg/hour = 66.666… hours\n\n\nOr, roughly 67 hours.\n\n\n\n\nSo, IVIG may take me between 3 and 67 hours to receive, per dose.\n\n\nThe reality is somewhere in between, since the rate fluctuates\n\n\nIn my experience, infusion took somewhere between 4-8 hours,\n\n\nwithout taking into account the logistical considerations\n\n\nof other appointments, tests, and the fact of getting to the hospital.\n\n\n\n\nThe bags of fluid hanging over the pump empty out\n\n\nand get replaced many times daily.\n\n\nSometimes they are medicine, sometimes they are\n\n\nsimply to keep the cannula from clogging.\n\n\nPassive, the body becomes a chemical battleground\n\n\nfor armies of vastly different scales while the\n\n\nmind occupies itself with other tasks.\n\n\nUnpredictable details of experience demand an awareness\n\n\nof one’s own existence in the world, collaborating with the machines,\n\n\nthe drugs, and the medical professionals all around\n\n\nand all implicated in the global flow of blood-derived-medicine.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I live transfusion?\n\n\nEach donor gives something essential with their plasma.\n\n\nThere is more than a material transfer of blood proteins happening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24 hours after treatment, the migraine hit. Beneath the\ncacophony of pressure pulsing in my skull I hear words, fragments of\nthought, worries and concerns: suicide; hunger; poverty; last resorts.\nTransfusion sends me spiralling through the night sky above Nepal.\nAlive, dancing a transient prayer in trance before a kneeling idol.\nVenus burns above. Lust seethes and bares its teeth, leaving fire trails\nof crimson until control is relinquished willingly. Then each bite tears\naway a part for itself, hungry ravenous flesh but not yours alone. We\nneed variety at this table if we are to dine joyfully. Dust flies with\nstep of the dancer’s bare feet. Communion intensifies and each\nparticipants feels the Arrival of death and love. Spiralling, to make\nknown that this body belongs to them. Please, they ask, allow me to\ngouge out your eyes, to enact the lessons of pain. Gouging must occur\nwithout anaesthetic of amphetamines of the kinds you give your soldiers.\nI’ll keep you isolated in a room with only the minimum necessary\nsustenance, have you reach the ground-state of sobriety. Don’t worry,\nyou’ll survive. I haven’t decided whether to use a fork or a spoon,\nwhich would you prefer? Open your eyes, the nurse tells me, the\ntreatment is over for today. Tell me you miss me. Tell me how our\ndistance is hurting you. Tell me how your skin longs for mine. Tell me\nhow your eyes hunt for mine. Tell me I’m enough of a woman for you. Tell\nme my anger is okay. Tell me you understand. Tell me my fear you love me\nless is unfounded. Stop telling me about other people, you’re the only\none that matters. Tell me your heart hurts too. Show me, rip out your\nsternum and tear apart your thorax and show me. Burning in my chest, our\ndistance subsides to hollowness when the fire dwindles. I wish I could\nscream and wail and break my mirror and immolate my bones if only to\nmake the feeling dissipate if only to make you go away if only if only\nif only it could turn to warm sadness I try to follow to its source that\nturns to rage again. Frustration. Would that I could rip out my valvular\npump and hold it up to my cornea, if looking is truly the most effective\nway to Know. Broad daylight, sun pierces through the canopy of broadleaf\ndeciduous life. A harsh metal scrape and the tearing of wood. Push,\npull, push, pull. A human-powered deforestation, saw in hand.\nMechanically we chant to keep the cadence, but I do not hear my own\nvoice. The tree interpellates me. What are we doing? Why take by\nmetallic force instead of asking for help? Don’t we know that our\nlarghissimo elders, the birches, the cedars, the maples, are ready to\nfall on their own if we speak the right words? But I do not heed this\ntrain of thought. The saw shakes in my grip and the tree is finally\nfelled. Would that I could freeze time and devote endless life to\nunderstanding pain’s anatomy. This pain is not my longing for you,\nthough my longing is there subsumed. This pain is bigger than I am, and\nnarrow as a platinum razor’s edge. A pickaxe in hand. Heavy beneath an\nempty stomach I dig at the grave I will inhabit soon enough. I do not\nknow when the end arrives. I ask myself whether my grandfather was right\nto fear death. At least I will get to stop digging. Nearby, a young man,\nyounger than me, grey with fatigue, falls. I await the inevitable order:\nOi! Heb das auf, stapel es mit den anderen. I do not complain, merely\ncomply, do not meet the soldier’s eyes. They lead nowhere I wish to go.\nHier la transfusion m’emmena à Kathmandou, il y a 12 générations.\nL’ancêtre sanguin se fit connaître. Je danse en prière devant une\ncroupissante idole. Vénus brûle au-dessus de moi, et je danse. Un cercle\nfiévreux se forme au rythme de mon corps. La poussière virevolte à\nchaque pas que prennent mes agiles pieds nus. La communion s’intensifie,\net tous nous ressentons l’Arrivée d’une déesse de l’amour et de la mort.\nJe tourbillonne, je dois être à sa hauteur, lui faire savoir que mon\ncorps est sien, qu’elle n’a qu’à me prendre dans ses bras. These words\nare neither me nor not me, not any more or less than the ten thousand\nsouls that inhabit me. The words: the plasma of thousands within my\nveins. Unknowable, yet pained. It is a matter of soul. Too much, too\nmany. Pressure builds. Only so much can be processed at once. Clogged up\nwith so many essences. The first 16 hours are the most revelatory. I\nknow during that period just how alive the plasma remains, dripping from\nthe flask. My blood is aflame, I run a fever. The first time I stood up,\nI thought perhaps a lifetime had gone. Every step riddled with latency,\nraising a thermometer takes eons. My vision is blurry, noisy. Each\ntwitch of a muscle clatters. Standing is akin to shattering a mountain.\nI find myself praying. First to Abraham’s God. Then Michaël, Raphaël.\nThen my grandparents. Then I beseech those souls directly coursing in my\nveins. I address them, plead for respite. Despite being of the blood,\nthey remember little of the pain of flesh. So it was that my body\nrecognized them, and did all in its power to remember suffering on their\nbehalf. The following night I dream long, beautiful dreams full of\nlonging. For place, for company, for shared meals. We argue\nwarmheartedly over what to get at the store. I float through the\nstoreroom. It was dark except for the flood of street-lamps through\nmakeshift curtains and we both scream ecstasy. Rolling over once the\nhigh leaves my muscles, touch reverts to terror. How many times did I\npush them away when I wished to hold us close? The weight of their body\nfelt crushing upon arms chest gut—any pressure brought a flood of fear.\nWhat if arteries pop veins rip flow ceases? My lover’s head resting upon\nmy chest brings it all back, the irrational bleeding mind, assailed by\nbodily doubt, harrowing anxieties.\nMemories of dark purple bulbs, protrusions and all any of us know of\nthem is bleeding. On a long bus ride, a friendship is forged in\nphilosophy, a bond of lovers. Ecstasy again awakens me and I find the\nmigraine mostly gone. So IVIG induced an experience of the sublime. It\nmight be an entheogen. One body is no proper container for thousands.\n\n\n\nHiromu Arakawa’s Fullmetal Alchemist\n\n\nis worth its weight in salt, sheer joy\n\n\nat the honest love and hate of characters at grips with truth.\n\n\nIf anyone wants to understand the experience of IVIG\n\n\nthey should try to understand Ed and Alphonse’s dad, Van Hohenheim.\n\n\n\n\nThe process of transfusion is one by which medicine\n\n\nturns Privigen® “human” again and creates\n\n\na homunculus of my body.\n\n\nEvery single donor\n\n\nis my ancestor,\n\n\nis my body,\n\n\nis me.\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been discussing the experiences of\n\n\ndonating plasma and receiving transfusions.\n\n\nWhile I am critical of the corporate practices\n\n\nwith which these are intertwined,\n\n\nI am not here to disparage the act of donating blood or plasma.\n\n\nI acknowledge that the scores of people who donate,\n\n\ncompensated or otherwise,\n\n\nare giving a gift to large swaths of the population.\n\n\nI am perhaps alive because of you.\n\n\nGiving blood facilitates life-saving medicine\n\n\non a daily basis.\n\n\nThe individuals involved in the blood economy\n\n\nare engaging in essential actions\n\n\nfor those of us whose bodies\n\n\nrequire regular or emergency assistance.\n\n\n\n\nThe fault does not reside within donation or transfusion.\n\n\nThese are simply material realities of medical practice.\n\n\nThe problem lies outside the classical frame of healthcare,\n\n\nwhere capital interests muddy the waters\n\n\nand turn healing into exploitation.\n\n\n\n\nMy goal is to offer another narrative,\n\n\none that runs parallel to that offered\n\n\nblood donors and the public,\n\n\nand in so doing, to shift perspective away\n\n\nfrom dominant discourses of Health.\n\n\nThe healthcare system has a dual purpose:\n\n\nit aims to rehabilitate sick people\n\n\nso that they can get back to work,\n\n\nand to maintain a relationship with the\n\n\nmedico-technical and pharmaceutical industries.\n\n\n\n\nIn doing so, the healthcare system acts\n\n\nas the distribution centre of the medical-industrial\n\n\ncomplex, simultaneously extracting money\n\n\nfrom individuals and governments\n\n\nfor the benefit of corporations,\n\n\nall the while “curing” people of their ills\n\n\nso that they may return to producing surplus value.\n\n\n\n\nPlasma Collection Centres choose to call\n\n\nthe sale of raw bodily material a donation,\n\n\nlinking it to the gift relationship with which people\n\n\nengage for no monetary compensation.\n\n\nThe rhetoric reveals the industry’s desire\n\n\nto appear as a benefactor,\n\n\nas falling in line with the purported\n\n\nmoral values of Healthcare.\n\n\nI suggest we call these places Extraction Centres,\n\n\nto be honest about the dividends demanded\n\n\nfrom processing raw material.\n\n\nYet the firms do not market themselves\n\n\nas extracting surplus value\n\n\nfrom the bodies of their “donors.”\n\n\n\n\nLet’s reorient perception of these companies\n\n\nas driven by profit,\n\n\nthus opening them up to a certain critique.\n\n\nBy aligning themselves with Healthcare,\n\n\na plasma extraction firm renders its operating strategy opaque.\n\n\nAccording to the rhetoric employed,\n\n\nthe system in place grants “donors” the privilege of doing good work.\n\n\nTechnoscientific capitalism would have its subjects believe that\n\n\nit is not at fault for making it necessary that low-income individuals\n\n\nsupplement their bottom-line by selling plasma.\n\n\nThe onus of choice is apparently placed on the individuals “donating,”\n\n\nbut many living in precarity have no other remaining options\n\n\nbut to sell their own flesh.\n\n\nThe moral sledgehammer falls heavy.\n\n\nMake cash, save lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican human-hours in the form of blood\n\n\ntrickle downwards through the global medical-industrial complex.\n\n\nOpposite the upward flow of taxpayer dollars\n\n\nin public healthcare systems buying plasma-derived drugs\n\n\n\n\nIn extracting plasma for profit, corporations are\n\n\ncontinually alienating poor working class people from their own bodies.\n\n\nOn the receiving end, the opaque nature of medicine works to pacify\n\n\nthe patients whose lives depend on an indefinite supply of transfusions,\n\n\nand what is taken from the ill person is\n\n\ntheir urgent need to struggle for change.\n\n\nIn the end, patients rarely protest against\n\n\nthe destructive and exploitative nature of healthcare.\n\n\nDonation and transfusion are counterparts,\n\n\nconcentrating human hours at opposite ends of the process,\n\n\noperating in clinical environments on opposing subjects.\n\n\n\n\nThe seemingly solitary experience of transfusion\n\n\nis an illusion\n\n\nshattered by acknowledging that Privigen®\n\n\ndeposits thousands of unknowable donors within my bloodstream.\n\n\nThe extraction of plasma is already an act of alienation,\n\n\nsplitting apart the components of human blood\n\n\nto harvest only that which is profitable.\n\n\nThe bodies at play are agents charged with their own histories,\n\n\nbut a patient is not necessarily aware of the systemic violence\n\n\nand ongoing oppressions which create\n\n\nthe global bloodstream as an industry.\n\n\n\n\nPatients whose wellbeing depends on\n\n\nan indefinite supply of plasma\n\n\nare often in the privileged position\n\n\nof being able not to ask too many questions\n\n\nabout the functioning of the system\n\n\nkeeping their symptoms at bay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe obfuscation of knowledge, the withholding,\n\n\nmay be crucial\n\n\nto the operation of the healthcare industry.\n\n\n\n\nIf all the histories that charge Privigen® were known,\n\n\npeople might refuse treatment, hurt profits.\n\n\n\n\nThe dilemma runs deep: what’s more important,\n\n\nmy own health, or that of 15000 impoverished “donors”?\n\n\n\n\nThat knowledge may also be too much,\n\n\nfor how can one body bear the violence\n\n\nenacted upon thousands?\n\n\n\n\nBy taking an interest in transfusion,\n\n\nand acknowledging the relationships\n\n\nthat are formed during the process,\n\n\na body regains agency,\n\n\nand becomes a source of gnosis.\n\n\n\n\nI was taught that my biology is not to be trusted.\n\n\nThe chemical decisions enacted in my\n\n\nbloodstream were the enemy.\n\n\n\n\nThe language used by doctors to describe auto-immunity\n\n\nmakes it seem like there a civil war raging,\n\n\nand the combatants are confused, engaging friendly-fire.\n\n\n\n\nBut that’s not what’s going on.\n\n\nAuto-immunity is a recalibration, a warning.\n\n\nA call to change habits, to listen closely to the invisible.\n\n\nHealing does not come from microscopes and pharmacology.\n\n\nThe way out of autoimmunity is the composition of a new body.\n\n\n\n\nIs there any truth to the proposition\n\n\nthat all our cells change every 7 years?\n\n\n\n\nMy body is a set of relationships\n\n\nbetween the visible and the invisible.\n\n\nA concerted effort has been sustained to render\n\n\never more of it visible through imaging technologies.\n\n\nBut what about the other senses?\n\n\nWhat about the corpuscles dedicated to sensing\n\n\nchemical balance in the bloodstream?\n\n\nWhat if those could be brought to individual awareness?\n\n\nI say they can.\n\n\n\n\nMy cure is not medicine, it is knowledge becoming love.\n\n\nKnowledge of my archive, of cell biology, of spiritual science, of\nquantum physics, of imperial histories, of medical politics, of\nsettler-colonial genealogies, magic, and my own soul.\n\n\nIntegrated experiences of medical trauma,\n\n\nloving kindness,\n\n\ndisillusionment.\n\n\nA will to trust in my own body’s capacity to heal\n\n\nto move into another version of self,\n\n\none in which the pharmacy does not\n\n\ndictate my realm of possibilities.\n\n\nA will to devote myself to myself each and every day,\n\n\nto learn how enmeshed my chemistry is with yours,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSickness in Limbo\n\n\n\n\nThrough the nascent storm, walk away from the river.\n\nIt’s my first winter near my grandfather’s grave,\n\n\non occupied territory first named Gespe’gewa’gi,\n\n\nseventh district of Mi’gma’gi,\n\n\nthe ancestral and unceeded territory of the Mi’gmaq,\n\n\nlater christened Sainte-Anne-Des-Monts by my ancestors.\n\n\nSeven-thousand inhabitants nestled\n\n\nalong the south bank of the St-Lawrence\n\n\n49° North.\n\n\nHere, on a clear day I can see the northern shoreline.\n\n\nHere, I’ve learned that the wind is a fickle dance partner.\n\n\nFrom the occulted beach, turn south.\n\n\nPace a side street amid bluster, foot after foot uphill in the\nsnowdrifts,\n\n\ntowards the CLSC perched above town.\n\n\nA reception clerk notifies the nurse of my arrival.\n\n\nI sit in the waiting room.\n\n\nI’m the only patient at first, but others soon arrive.\n\n\n\n\nToday is March 5th, 2021, and I am still healing.\n\n\nI await results, self-reparation.\n\n\nWhat does the blood have to say, today?\n\n\nI am repentant in the face of medicine,\n\n\nI’ve come back after voluntary cessation of treatment.\n\n\nI considered the immediate alternatives\n\n\nand found the pharmakon I know will at least mitigate symptoms,\n\n\nif never cure.\n\n\n\n\nMy intestines weep red and I wipe away tears alongside feces.\n\n\nNow is not the time to gamble.\n\n\nPatiently sit in a black plastic chair supported by a stainless-steel\nframe,\n\n\nseparate from the others visible through plexiglass bolted to the wall.\n\n\nPostered on the wall there’s a PSA about STI tests,\n\n\na showcase of lovers in ecstatic touch.\n\n\nMatthieu-Xavier’s name is called.\n\n\nI pull my gaze away from the illustrated longing\n\n\nand towards an old nurse named Thomas.\n\n\nHe’s cheerful, deftly handles the needle.\n\n\nHis steady hands are the only human touch I feel each week.\n\n\nWe talk about the weather as he draws blood.\n\n\nThis winter, so he says, “has been exceptional, truly.\n\n\nExceptionally warm, and brief, and bereft of snow.\n\n\nTrust me, this is nothing.”\n\n\n\n\nBefore the time of remote friendships, in a limbo reserved for the sick,\n\n\nI’m comforted by broken bread shared with others\n\ncaught in their own ouroboros.\n\nEach chronically healing body differs in its minutiae,\n\n\nyet sickness breeds a hearth around which to gather and keep warm.\n\n\nI reach out towards the fire, grateful for company that is not charity.\n\n\nGrateful for those whose “I’m sorry” is not pity.\n\n\nThere is no pretence, no brave faces.\n\n\nNo imperative to cater to the comfort\n\n\nof those who believe they are forever healthy.\n\n\nI wager that for the sick, those who know that healing is cyclical,\n\n\na pandemic’s disruption of time may have felt familiar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis pandemic has shown me that\n\n\ndiscussions of illness are no longer concerned with\n\n\nthe need to convince or remind the healthy that their certainty,\n\n\nthe self-assured confidence of perpetual health, is illusory.\n\n\nThe news media has done a thorough job of\n\n\ninstilling fear, breeding anxiety, and perpetuating\n\n\nthe poisonous narrative that is the hero’s journey.\n\n\nFrom healthy,\n\n\nto sick, soon to be healthy again,\n\n\ndisease must be overcome.\n\n\nIllness must be overcome.\n\n\nSo goes the story.\n\n\nThe calendar lies in tatters at my feet,\n\n\ntorn pages unstitched as despair and hope\n\n\nenmesh in a spiral dance, a whirlwind\n\n\nshreds my abdomen while delirium burns around me,\n\n\nfear succeeds joy and, impatient to get a move on,\n\n\nI dream of spring.\n\n\nHow long is a year, then?\n\n\nAmidst a turmoil of organs, unsettled feuds remain.\n\n\n\n\nNeedled for a thousand blood draws,\n\n\nI’ve come to reject the fiction of illness.\n\n\nThe global immune response to crisis\n\n\nthrows into sharp relief that healing is a learned skill.\n\n\nThere is no plotted course, no long-term plans,\n\n\nbut illness is not the only story,\n\n\nand I devise strategies for a sick life.\n\n\nI remind myself that healing goes on in illness,\n\n\nthat there is no miraculous cure-all.\n\n\nInner awareness, rest, and time off\n\n\nare necessary tools for survival.\n\n\n\n\nI am responsible for my own touch-starved self\n\n\nand those few with whom I conspire.\n\n\nI strive to tune into the resonance\n\n\nby which I may make my way my own.\n\n\nIt begins when I listen to the flesh.\n\n\nThen, breathe with the world and find myself\n\n\nat home within the web of ongoing creation.\n\n\nStand still by the estuary\n\n\nbefore the mouth of the river Sainte-Anne\n\n\nas it pours into the St-Lawrence.\n\n\nIce shatters, sends waves up my spine,\n\n\nand I know that the invisible flows\n\n\nbeneath the rustle of snow\n\n\nare the same movements felt in my veins\n\n\nand heard in the cracks of the ice.\n\n\nWarmed by the sun under the vertiginous turquoise sky,\n\n\nI give thanks for the chance to live such beauty\n\n\nanother day, another night.\n\n\nCOVID-19 will “end.” The news cycles and feeds will move on.\n\n\nWhat then? Will the transience of the body itself\n\n\nhave gained any respect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring turns to summer\n\n\nsolar rays are talismanic but no protection\n\n\nagainst the biting flies.\n\n\nIt is July 2021.\n\n\nDeep in the forests of the Bas-Saint-Laurent,\n\n\nstiff limbs shed fatigue as they awaken to use.\n\n\nMonths go by without a blood test.\n\n\nHands learn to craft metal and till the dirt.\n\n\nI spend a week reworking a tin crucifix\n\n\ninto a solar necklace.\n\n\nRip Jesus off his cross.\n\n\nRend the soft metal into a new shape\n\n\nand sand away decades of rust.\n\n\nBy the time I’m done it’s a triangular pendant\n\n\nwith a soft gold sheen.\n\n\nI give it to my grandmother,\n\n\nthe first piece of jewelry I ever made.\n\n\n\n\nBlack flies are unavoidable but plantain leaf\n\nmakes an effective poultice.\n\nI learn to walk, tread through the fields\n\nof foxtail and couch-grass,\nattuned to the pollinators whose hum guides my step.\n\nHealing is of the dirt and water, my breath, my bones.\n\n\nHealing is the love I hold for my body’s proteins.\n\nIts ligatures, its fats, sugars, spinal liquidity,\nand all the microbes with whom I share these cells.\n\nHealing is that peculiar sensation in the optic nerve\n\nconfronted with sublimity,\nan old growth forest or an open sky.\n\nThe muscular jouissance of a footstep.\n\n\nSickness is in the chemical agonists at work on my spine’s marrow.\n\n\nSickness is the rigidity of my fascia.\n\nI have so much to learn of healing from the trees,\nthe birds, the frogs.\nThe creak of limbs 50 feet above me,\nthe withering bark, the barren branches.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutumn, the black tar spot on fallen maple leaves,\n\n\nthe first scent of snow. The murder croaks at dawn.\n\n\nThe black birds are telling me to pray, to notice the decay.\n\n\n\n\nBattered by winter, it is unclear\n\n\nwhether fatigue is physical or existential.\n\n\nOr it is both.\n\n\nI am an aquifer, from which Thomas’ needle\n\nextracts groundwater.\n\nInto the vial my blood flows,\n\n\nexamined for deficiency to track my risk of bleeding.\n\n\nBut sickness extends beyond the blood\n\n\nit will not be contained by any such essentializing.\n\n\nI am tackling the problem of healing in the long term.\n\n\nSickness, lived not as something to cure,\n\n\nescape, climb out of, but as a maze\n\n\nfrom which there is no exit, no future.\n\n\nHealing is a labyrinth: it is the snake eating its tail.\n\n\nHealing is acknowledging that Akeso\n\n\nis too the daughter of Asclepius.\n\n\nTreating such complexities with words,\n\n\nin an attempt to cure pathology\n\n\naccording to numbers on a chart,\n\n\nall this is too abstract.\n\n\nHealing is anything but theory.\n\n\nWithout the imperative to strive\n\n\nfor a mythical life free from illness,\n\n\na sick existence breeds wondrous possibility.\n\n\nI am armed with fresh clay through which I mold my body;\n\n\nreams of blank paper upon which to compose symphonies.\n\n\nThe possibilities are not so remote. I choose to live\n\n\nnow the universal flourishing of an eternal recurring eden.\n\n\nI am not in a circle of hell,\n\n\nbut a quiet place, a simple place.\n\n\nNot the void, but somewhere to gather\n\n\nand sing songs.\n\n\n\n\nThomas withdraws the needle,\n\n\naffixes a small bandage to the leaky prick,\n\n\nsecures it with plastic medical tape.\n\n\nI will wash off the gummy residue for three days.\n\n\nI thank him and say, “see you next week.”\n\n\nBack outside, the blizzard has thickened.\n\n\nAcross the hospital parking lot,\n\n\nI can’t see the water in the distance.\n\n\nI glean the outline of an oversized,\n\n\nwhite-painted wooden cross planted at the cliff’s edge.\n\n\nOn a clear day the visibility stretches for miles,\n\n\nrounding the horizon.\n\n\nSo, I’m back to the walk, foot after foot,\n\n\ndown towards the river, north,\n\n\ndown the same path I followed up,\n\n\narm cradled to staunch the pinpoint wound,\n\n\ncurious whether today it will leave a bruise.\n\n\n\n\nI do not refuse sickness,\n\n\nI do not refuse the ongoing collapse\n\n\nof so much I took for granted.\n\n\nI strive for love in limbo and accept\n\n\nthat which I cannot control,\n\n\nto better make meaning\n\n\nfrom those minuscule decisions that shape each day.\n\n\nI am doing things, moving by stillness.\n\n\nI do all I can. The best with what is, right now.\n\n\nThe answers come only with time, unbidden, like old friends.\n\n\nNo right, no wrong. I am still healing.\n\n\nI still take pills and attempt to make sense\n\n\nof this body’s enigma.\n\n\nI know I am not alone in this, even if isolated in the cold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Spring Spent Nannying\n\n\n\n\nI left home to the tune of Daydream Nation.\nShe said: I wanted to map the exact dimensions of hell.\nDoes this sound simple?\nMay 8th\n“We’re all gonna die!

Auto-immunity demands surrender, re-evaluation of what makes you\nhuman, what makes you you.\n\n\n4. There is no such thing as health.\n\n\n5. Auto-immunity shatters the telos upon shores of blood, treatment of\nsymptoms agonizes the root cause.\n\n\n6. Auto-immunity is not an illness, it is endowment with strength,\npower, knowledge\n\n\n7. Auto-immunity is self-knowledge, a map, responsibility.\n\n\n8. Through auto-immunity, universal entanglements reverberate in felt\nsense.\n\n\n9. Auto-immunity is not a curse, it is the wise wound within the body.\n\n\n10. I would rather be sick and cunning than healthy and dull.\n\n\n11. If I am sick, the land is sick.\n\n\n12. Auto-immunity is the body in revolt against global poisoning.\n\n\n13. Auto-immunity transcends identity.\n\n\n14. Culture is auto-immune.\n\n\n15. Auto-immunity diffracts the body’s holistic context.\n\n\n16. You can be auto-immune without conscious acceptance. Soon enough,\nyour body will tell you.\n\n\n17. Auto-immunity is a form of mourning; the body grieving worldly\ncruelty.\n\n\n18. Auto-immunity is a call to listen.\n\n\n19. Auto-immunity is inexorable change.\n\n\n20. Auto-immunity is embodied heresy.\n\n\n21. Auto-immunity is both constructive and destructive interference.\n\n\n22.

Akeso is an alchemist. Akeso is temperance.\nSometimes harsh, sometimes gentle.\nAlways attuned to the needs of healing.\nThey do not heal so much as guide\nthe sick towards convalescence,\nregeneration, re(in)storing their own capacity for recuperation.\nFrom Ancient Greek Ἀκεσώ (Akesṓ).\nIn Portuguese, Galician, Italian, related to:\n(transitive) to light, set alight, ignite, kindle\n(transitive) to turn on (a device)\n(transitive, figuratively) to fire up\n\n\nSo I read here a relation to training, practice,\nan ongoing effort to deepen devotion and commitment.\nThe ascetic is traditionally a lone practitioner,\nmore closely related with the hermit\nthan the communal monastic (french: cénobite).\nThe ascetic need not preach, or attempt to convert others to their\ncause.\nThe definitions of asceticism I’ve found\ncommonly point towards either a moral practice or an artistic practice.\nI am more aligned with ascesis as an art.\nThis is not a moral undertaking.\nRather, it is a response to global poisoning,\nand a way to claim personal well-being,\nindividual action, pure negation.\nMaking space for something else.\nMy nascent asceticism acknowledges\nthat “the world” will not be saved,\nthat no saviour exists outside myself,\nthat supply chain collapse is ongoing,\nthat consumption wreaks havoc upon personal autonomy.\nThe practice involves learning to discern need from want,\nsensing when want is an external imposition,\nand refusing all that does not serve Life.\nIf, as Mircea Eliade suggests,\nthe sacred is defined spatially,\ncomes into being through delimitation,\nexists as the exceptional place (Foucault’s heterotopia),\nthen the Sacred is a standpoint to adopt,\na place from which to survey the wasteland,\nand a devotee’s habit to don as sheer refusal.\nRefusal to engage with the profane,\nrefusal to inhabit the culture that continues to wreak havoc,\nrefusal to consume its commodities.\nRare is tuberculosis, yet how many still die consumptive?\n\n\nLiving a sacred life necessarily means acknowledging divinity;\nnot as god-almighty-on-high, merely as that-which-is.\nFor now, suffice to say divinity exists as an experience.\nThe metaphors for its facade are numerous.\nKeep the practice joyful,\nmake room for physical pleasure,\nsensuousness, salaciousness.\nRefuse to imbibe the pornographer’s easy meals.\nRefuse the ready-to-think.\nRefuse the pre-fabricated desires.\nAbstain from cherry-picked realms of possibility.\nAsceticism is the study of Life.\nIt is a syncretic approach,\nmeaning it takes what works from anywhere,\nand refuses nonsense from anywhere.\nIn practice, the ascetic hones their sense of discernment,\ntheir sensitivity, their bullshit detectors.\nThis is, ultimately, a game to play.\nInward, the search begins.\nThe search for that which is not spoken of.\nBut for whom is initiation an option in the first place?\nAnd where, now, is the line between the speakable and the unspeakable?\nAny wisdom gained will only be the wisdom of a dying civilization.\nPray to the old and new gods.\nWorship in whatever way makes sense to you,\nand do not expect your rites to make sense to your children.\nRites and ceremonies are potent tools.\nFrom such movements arises gnosis,\ndeeply affecting practitioners and,\nif devotion is sincere, changing the core of orientation to Life.\nRitual holds the power to transform one’s own world,\nand learn about the shared realities.\nCeremony alone, however, is hollow.\nIt is needfully directed by conscious control of the individual,\notherwise known as will, intent, attention, focus.\nWithout focus, ceremony is void of potency.\nSome things are certain:\nhonestly performing established scripts leads to results,\nand the results can profoundly alter experience.\nMagic is a metaphor,\nuseful for making individual sense of patterns\nthat are too big to hold in the conscious mind.\nIt is an orientation device for mentation,\nand useful for someone\nwho feels called to power for its own sake.\nBut why bother?\nAn ascetic approach acknowledges the ongoing process.\nI inhabit the world of my own making,\nwhile factors which I do not consciously hold in mind\ncontinue to affect actions/decisions/options.\nThe theory is meaningless on its own.\nStudy for its own sake is navel-gazing.\nOverloading intellect with big words\nin the hope of spontaneously getting it leads nowhere,\nnot even disillusion. It is necessary to experiment, and to fail.\nWhatever feels intuitive is a clue.\nWhatever poses challenges but keeps interest is another.\nThere is much less to learn from other people than expected.\nAuto-didactics are a key factor.\nDesire is another.

Si la tristesse\nest présente, c’est qu’elle l’est\ntoujours, vivant en temps de deuil.\n\n\nAlors j’imagine le soleil\net les amix\net les abeilles\net je me dis que chaque moment\nvécu pleinement\nest en soi une forme révolutionnaire\nEt chaque rêve raconté\nme rapproche du monde désiré\nde l’autre côté de cette folie collective\nque les dormeurs ne remarquent même pas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Things Change\n\n\n\n\nThis 25th year of my life marks a shift.\nAs all rites of passage, I had to shed any notions of knowing\nwho, where, when, and why I was.\nAs all thresholds, the other side was invisible from the entryway,\nunknown and unknowable to me.\nThe morass of digital communication weighs heavy,\nand isolation is not aided by over-engagement.\nI discern conflicting impulses within myself,\ndoubts and trust coexisting, and feel on the verge of birth.\nPerhaps this is because I will soon turn 26.\nPerhaps this is because the past year has held\ninexpressable lows and vertiginous highs.\nI had ceased all medical supervision,\nbelieving then, as i do now,\nthat I am better equipped to heal myself\nthan any other doctor.\nHubris was my downfall,\nas were a series of mistakes\nstemming from hurried action\nchasmic gaps in my own knowledge.\nThe refusal to take my pills had the effect\nof revealing symptoms that had lain dormant for a decade.\nI precipitated this, stepping wildly through a thick fog\non the frozen banks of the river sainte-anne, praying,\nhoping that health would occur spontaneously.\nNow, where I then had only fear and longing,\nI now have words to describe that particular crisis of healing.\nAn inapt diet was the catalyst for toxemia\nand the emergence of dysbiosis,\nor, the sheer destruction of the microbiome\nwhch protects and regulates my organism.\nI was vulnerable, my gut homeostasis was fragile\nfrom 20 years of regular subjection to antiobiotics and other poisons.\nMy years of binge drinking taught me,\neventually, the value of abstention,\nbut not how to go about caring for a body\ntaxed heavily by the drugs of modern life.\nFrom the moment I started drinking, I abused my liver.\nFrom the day I got on Revolade, I imposed undue stress on my liver.\nIt’s where I am now holding tension still.\nRight where the diaphragm meets the top of the liver.\nSo a year ago, I was alone with my symptoms.\nI decided then the drug I’d been prescribed\nand taking since 2015 would still be of use.\nA new doctor took the place of the old.\nThis specialist I’ve never met,\nand whose voice I only ever hear in 10 minute increments,\nmobilized the machine of pharmacy.\nThe wait for renewal, mere weeks, was too long.\nBlood tests indicated a need for emergency treatments.\nSo, under the needle and the crystalline bag I went.\nI partook in the logistical ritual of medicine once more.\nThe top floor of the CISSS de la Haute-Gaspésie\nwelcomes me onto the colonized land of Gespe’gewa’gi.\nSterile, this new waiting room.\nI wait patiently until Marie calls me to her,\nand I walk to treatment, my bright blue-slippered feet\nfollow her to the hall of recliners.\n\n\nI’ve learned compassion from the plasma of strangers.\nThe 21st century corruption of the gift relationship\nhas joined us locally, mixed our waters.\nBirth circumstances on this artificially fractured continent\nplace us on either side of a free trade agreement.\nMy doctor’s signature on the prescription\nreaches across time and binds me to the donors\nwhose act expedites my temporary cure.\nThe thousands become my bio-spiritual ancestors\nand theirs are lessons to heed in the blood.\nHow am I to understand transfusion?\nIt’s a slow remembering, a reconstruction.\nDrop by crystal drop the infusion is vetted, approved, absorbed.\nThe memory is wholly mine, but the blood is legion.\nI won’t pretend to understand all the mechanisms at work\npharmacokinetics and the like.\nMedicine has its explanations for what I’ve undergone;\nThis pamphlet is my own interpretation.\nI’m struggling to make sense\nof what those 72 hours post-IVIG mark in my life.\nI had just turned 25. I was looking for answers,\nhaving not yet learned that, at best,\nI can merely refine my questions.\nAt the time, it felt like something profound ought to come from agony.\nBut perhaps it is the banality, the ultimate meaninglessness of\nside-effects\nthat is revealed here. What right have I to claim some importance,\nto ascribe meaning to the everyday? Remember this: we all suffer.\n\n\n\nThe meaning is not in the suffering itself.\n\nHow could I possibly justify painkillers if it were?\nIs sense experience inherently meaningful?\n\nIs anaesthesia, then, a poison, chilling the soul\n\nas well as the body?\n\nOught I have let the migraine run its course\n\nwithout those little tylenol pills?\n\nWhat experience or insight did I deprive myself of\n\nby choosing to minimize pain?\n\nIs this line of questioning merely playing\n\ninto a masochist hero’s narrative?\n\nOr a fantasy of the tortured mystic?\n\n\nAnother question in progress:\n\n\nHow do the pharmaco-kinetics of intravenous blood products\n\n\naffect bio-spiritually intra-acting bodies?\n\n\nSimple: I do not know.\n\n\n\n\nIn the midst of pandemic,\n\n\nI shed many of my preconceived notions\n\n\nI had long held about my own reality.\n\n\nI was (and am) giving serious consideration\n\n\nto the aspects of my experience\n\n\nthat I could not fit into a materialist framework.\n\n\n\n\nI dove, alone, ever deeper into myself,\n\n\naway from as much of the noise as I could,\n\n\nand found faith in the existence of divinity on earth.\n\n\n\n\nI found that even as I critically examine\n\n\nthe claims of charlatans\n\n\nand continue to reject their postural pretences,\n\n\ntheir false certainties, their easy assurances,\n\n\nthere is an intangible, indefinite, inner resonance\n\n\nto the notion that this human body\n\n\nis a direct conduit for my experience of god.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know now that healing is a series of definite mechanisms\n\n\nharnessing the body’s innate capacity for adaptation.\n\n\nMy path is aligned with the middle way, the way of the heart.\n\n\nI am neither shunning my embodied state,\n\n\nnor am I attached to it as a stable, unshifting identity.\n\n\nWithout striving towards any spiritual goal,\n\n\nI remain aware of the continual tension between edifice and dissolution.\n\n\n\n\nI practice in order to neither hold on to my biographical history\n\n\nas the sole source of my identity, nor relinquish\n\n\nthe potential for transformation that inheres\n\n\nto the condition of being alive as a human being.\n\n\n\n\nJouissance is an aspect of the art of getting lost.\n\n\nCreative forgetfulness is part of the way.\n\n\nInternal alchemy is the process of consciously rearranging one’s inner\nbeing.\n\n\n\n\nI am not enlightened, nor is it true that I know nothing at all.\n\n\nI am slowly knowing myself, and I know what I’ve learned,\n\n\nwhat I’ve experienced. I know some of what I do not know.\n\n\nI am not merely an empty vessel for divinity,\n\n\nbut a collaborator with the universal forces.\n\n\nBeing me is a worthwhile endeavour in and of itself,\n\n\nand so is noting the patterns that have calcified\n\n\nover the course of my life so far.\n\n\n\n\nThe river thaws, its flows inexorable.\n\n\nI practice lovingkindness for the land itself,\n\n\nthe boulders in Rivière-Du-Loup’s Parc Des Chutes, the moss.\n\n\nMay they be at peace, free from suffering.\n\n\nHollow human words for a stone,\n\n\nyet the resonance from the heart center is true, real.\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the land need?\n\n\nTime, which it has.\n\n\nLove, presence, acknowledgement.\n\n\nThe dirt is not alone, I am here.\n\n\nWe are here, those of us who are awake\n\n\nwith compassion for the web of life.\n\n\n\n\nHold the bodies close together\n\n\nand find they resolve into\n\n\ndissolution, disillusion. One\n\n\nflesh precludes not another.\n\n\nOne voice does not make a chorus.\n\n\n\n\nListen to the silence of the hum-\n\n\ndrum daily affairs, and find\n\n\ncracks through which to slip\n\n\nin which to get lost. Only\n\n\nwith loss does the finding\n\n\nhave meaning. Only after does\n\n\nbefore have value. Not a comparison\n\n\nto draw between discrete units\n\n\nbut an exponential resonance\n\n\nwhen the cycle is acknowledged\n\n\nin its full ongoing dream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmaller, still\n\n\n2022-08-22\n\n\n\n\nSo many options &amp; \nsome are true but\nfew and far between\ncome from the honest calling\nReady to do not doing\nPractice insight\nClear some shadows\nLearn thyself\nMaybe just\ndo nothing\nover\nand over\nand over\nuntil the moment\nof truth\nDynamism gives takes\npush pull\nLanguage weighs heavy\nwords create mere illusion\nAnd so I am an illusionist\nseeking to find release\nfrom the bondage of my silver tongue.\n\n\nOn July 8th , 2022, I journaled: “where’s that feeling of enoughness?”\nSatiety needs not just food.\nIt asks intimacy, touch, connection.\nI believe in love and creation.\nLife is infinite imagination.\nCulture is malleable clay.\nRemember pain is part of the work.\nAn integral piece of healing is hurt.\nThe wise wounds are the teachers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end // À Suivre\n\n\n\n\n\nA long winding path, tremulously lit.\n\n\nTraveler, there is no road.\n\n\n\n\nI am crossing time\n\n\neach of my selves\n\n\nconceived otherwise\n\n\nleap through one another in memory.\n\n\n\n\nThe road is made as you go\n\n\nBut tell me more about this path.\n\n\nIt is ever present, shifting\n\n\nNot to accommodate,\n\n\nThough it remains navigable.\n\n\nDivergences cease to exist\n\n\nOnce a decision has been made\n\n\nThe path is only travelled once\n\n\nThough it may come back around.\n\n\nEach day along the path brings new learning\n\n\nThe feeling of the path changes\n\n\nCome now, you’re already on your way\n\n\nThe path is shared by all, and differs for each.\n\n\n\n\nAs of writing, it is January 2024.\n\n\n\n\nI have been in remission for two years.\n\n\nMy last dose of IVIG was Feb 2021.\n\n\nI haven’t set foot in a hospital since December 2021.\n\n\n\n\nI stopped taking my platelet boosters,\n\n\nself-supervised, without any Doctor’s orders.\n\n\nI haven’t taken any pharmaceutical medicine since March 2022.\n\n\nThe seeds of my practice are all present in this book, if you look for\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nI have given myself to the art of nourishing life.\n\n\n\n\nI am changing.\n\n\nThe process will never be complete,\n\n\nbecause it is not something with an end goal.\n\n\nI have befriended my body.\n\n\nI sing, and dance, and pray.\n\n\n\n\nThe story laid out in the preceding pages is only a fraction of reality.\n\n\nForgive me, that I could not be more thorough.\n\n\nThis edition of the book arose out of a need to publish quickly,\n\n\nan irresistible urge to finish.\n\n\nAs such, I take full responsibility for any errors, typos, repetition,\n\n\nor other mistakes that would have been easily resolved\n\n\nby working with more time,\n\n\nbut the text asked to see the light of day.\n\n\n\n\nThis remains but a fragment,\n\n\nthere is so much more to life.\n\n\n\n\nI am publishing this book to open a dialogue.\n\n\nIn honour of all those who’ve come before\n\n\nand all those who’ve yet to arrive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks:\n\n\nBellamie, Dodie.

Security guards mill about,\na nondescript hospital employee guides people where they need to go.\nDo you have an appointment? Where are you headed?\nCentre Intégré de Cancérologie, 14th floor,\nI’ve got a blood test today.\nOh, you know you have a separate entrance and elevators right?\nHere, this way, come with me.\nBy coming in through there, you won’t have to wander\nthe entire hospital or touch stuff that’s “disinfected”\nthough no one really cleans it.\nThank you, I say, and ponder the horror of that last statement as I disinfect my hands again though I haven’t touched anything and make my way to the Oncology-Elevators. Two of us are whisked up in a socially-distanced elevator ride. Maximum occupancy of 4, one person per floor-sticker.\nUpstairs I am greeted by a nurse who asks the usual symptom-probes.\nThe nurse’s right hand brushes up against my palms as she leans in\nto spray sanitizer and disinfect me once more.\nI didn’t even press the elevator buttons.\nA volunteer in a polka-dot bow-tie\nwalks me down the long waiting room\nto point out the blood work reception desk,\nwhich has not moved in the 6 months since I was last here.\nI was supposed to return sooner, of course.\nThey’ve been working on adding a third even taller wing to the CHUM. In the waiting room I always look down at the progress. Almost done now. Not just another hole in the ground.\nI used to get my blood tests done at Notre-Dame, an old old hospital on Sherbrooke, opened in 1880. The CHUM, built in 2017, has another high capacity blood-draw clinic on the main floor of D-wing, but I’ve never sat there in that glass box within the heart of the skyscraper complex with no view outside for patients. For some reason I take the elevator to Oncology.\nOnce though I stayed overnight at the Nouveau-CHUM in an ER hallway on a cot under fluorescents. It was mid-march of 2019. I sat in receptive silence, half-lotus, eyes closed, listening, not sleeping. Notice, the overworked nurses are torn between the desire to provide comfort and the expectation of staying back, respecting the distance imposed by pain, by sickness. How does it feel to have disease constantly on your mind? Every conversation I’ve had in the past week has either been about illness or violence.\nIn the morning my managing haematologist was on duty and came to see me at bedside.\nI said I’m fine.\nHe said\nYou’re not fine listen to these numbers.\nWe’ll up your dose of Revolade\nDeliver intravenous iron\nand Request an appointment with the gastroenterologist\nbecause surely if you’re this anaemic your stomach must be bleeding.\nAlright then, I guess.\nAs he discharges me, the doctor jokes\nabout how nice the rooms are up on the 15th floor,\nas if hospitalization is the right thing to chuckle warmly about.\nI think he’s well-intentioned and has a good grasp of haematological\nmedicine but I was glad to leave, go home,\nand spend a month in bed resting\nwhile the weather turned warm.\nOut the 14th floor waiting-room window I see the sky, the city, beyond.\nNearby another patient sits down and opens a book:\nThe Most Beautiful Quebecois Poems.\nI glance back outside\na small brown-speckled spider weaves its web\nacross the glass. From where I’m standing\nit’s bigger than the construction workers,\nbigger than the pedestrians, almost the size of the police cruiser\ntwo intersections away. Waiting there,\nrefusing to sit in the disinfected chairs,\nI wonder what good all the poetry in the world\nwill do this single arachnid\nspinning its home over Mooniyang.\nThe centre de prélèvements is a resolutely hygienic space.\nBlood draws occur 7am-3pm M-F.\nWait times are short for patients who get blood taken here up high.\nI ask a nurse how many blood tests a day she’s doing lately.\nIt depends, but a little over 100.\nWe’re checking my auto-immune system,\nit’s been known to eat away at me.\nPlatelets, also called thrombocytes,\nare tiny cells that are essential for normal blood clotting.\nWhen platelets are particularly low,\ninternal bleeding is a risk,\nand I get acutely aware of my skin’s surfaces\nits folds, distracted by specks of the outer world\nthat brush up against it, egg-albumin thin.\nThe circulatory system is a series of veinous corridors,\nhighways, canals, transit arteries carrying blood along.\nThe lightest pressure might bruise and the lightest scrape might tear.\nSo we test.\nSharp metal insertion somewhere along the arm. Middling.\nPrimary symptoms are: excessive bruising, bruising in excess of what one would’ve expected for the amount of trauma, or bruises that are totally unexplained.\nWhen my daily life is asymptomatic, the blood work makes sure to rectify the notion that everything is normal. Platelet counts outside the norm have been my everyday for 19 years. I wonder whether we’ll get to stop counting anytime soon?\nInternal bleeding’s a slow dissolving of veinous layers melding into a contiguous ocean of blood. Carefully mapped out roads falling into disarray as in-betweens flood. Microscopic terror as a shortage of platelets leads to tidal waves overcoming the sea walls under maintained, decimated by an overzealous team of white blood cells.\nIf this shows up to the naked eye at all, it’s usually as ‘petechiae’; tiny red pinpoints in the skin, little red-blue dots along the arms, the legs, around the groin. Mini-bruises.\nEven invisible illness is subject to sight. Can we stop counting anytime soon? Put blood under a microscope and find out just how its balance turns out. Break it down into categories for testing, count out with frightening exactitude just how much of this that and whatever else my body happened to contain at 7:32am on August 25th, 2020.\nMy haematologist’s job is precisely to make sense of the clinical minutiae contained within blood. Logic takes a crack at making sense of our lifeblood, and I can’t help but laugh.\nIt’s time I got out of here."}}
